# Network Debug Configuration
# This file controls network debugging, bandwidth logging, and performance monitoring.
#
# Changes to this file require restarting Forge to take effect.

# ============================================================
# Bandwidth Logging
# ============================================================
# Enable bandwidth tracking and delta sync comparison logging.
# When enabled, shows three measurements per packet:
#   - Approximate size (delta algorithm efficiency)
#   - Actual network bytes (ground truth with compression)
#   - Full state estimate (baseline for comparison)
#
# Console output example:
#   [DeltaSync] Packet #1: Approximate=320 bytes, ActualNetwork=450 bytes, FullState=1200 bytes
#   [DeltaSync]   Savings: Approximate=73%, Actual=62% | Cumulative: ...
#
# Performance impact: ~1-2% when enabled, 0% when disabled
# Default: true (enabled for development/debugging)
bandwidth.logging.enabled=true

# ============================================================
# Network Debug Logger
# ============================================================
# Enable/disable debug logging for network synchronization.
# When disabled, no log files are created and no console output is shown.
# Default: true (enabled for development/debugging)
debug.logger.enabled=true

# Console log level: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
# Controls what is printed to the console (System.out)
# DEBUG = Very verbose (hex dumps, property details, collections)
# INFO  = Normal operation (sync start/end, summaries)
# WARN  = Potential issues (missing objects, unexpected states)
# ERROR = Failures and exceptions
# Default: INFO (shows important events without flooding console)
debug.logger.console.level=INFO

# File log level: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
# Controls what is written to the log file (logs/network-debug-*.log)
# Default: DEBUG (captures everything for post-mortem analysis)
debug.logger.file.level=DEBUG

# ============================================================
# Log Management
# ============================================================
# Maximum number of log files to retain (default: 20)
# When this limit is exceeded, the oldest log files are automatically deleted.
# Set to 0 to disable the limit and keep all logs (useful for development).
# Note: Files modified within the last 5 minutes are never deleted (grace period
# for multiple running instances).
# TEMPORARILY SET TO 0 FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING (was: 20)
debug.logger.max.logs=0

# Enable automatic cleanup of old log files (default: true)
# When disabled, log files accumulate indefinitely regardless of max.logs setting.
# TEMPORARILY DISABLED FOR COMPREHENSIVE TESTING (was: true)
debug.logger.cleanup.enabled=false

# Directory where log files are stored (default: logs)
# Can be an absolute path or relative to the working directory.
# The directory will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.
debug.logger.directory=logs

# ============================================================
# Notes for Production Deployment
# ============================================================
# For production releases, consider:
#   - bandwidth.logging.enabled=false (reduces overhead)
#   - debug.logger.enabled=false (no log files)
#   - debug.logger.console.level=ERROR (only show critical issues)
#
# For development/testing, current defaults are recommended.
