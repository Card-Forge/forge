M21 Pre-release.
Mutate is NOT finished yet. Please be patient.
Companion is in, but unfortunately Wizards changed the rules on us. We'll get the new rules in when we can.
[b]Forge now requires Java 8 (or newer). You will not be able to start the game if you are not yet running Java 8.[/b]
We have a Discord server for hanging out with Forge devs and other Forge fans. Feel free to [url=https://discord.gg/3v9JCVr]jump on in and say hi[/url]!
