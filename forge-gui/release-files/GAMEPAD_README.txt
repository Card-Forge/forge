Basic Gamepad Support for Adventure Mode

Tested using DS4 COntroller on Windows and Android.

If using on Windows OS and you have DS4Windows installed, you might experience dual input because of Emulated/Virtual Controller. To fix this you must use HidHide (better than exclusive mode). Refer to the guide here:

Other XInput Controller should work, XBox or DS4 Preferaably and other similar XInput Controller with comparable button layout. Custom Key Mapping is not yet supported.
