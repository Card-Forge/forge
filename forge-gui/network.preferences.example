# Network Debug Preferences Example
# Copy this file to ~/.forge/preferences/network.preferences (Linux/Mac)
# or %APPDATA%\Forge\preferences\network.preferences (Windows)
#
# NOTE: Comments are supported when reading the file, but will be removed
# when Forge saves preferences. This is a limitation of the PreferencesStore
# pattern used by Forge.
#
# Changes require restarting Forge to take effect.
