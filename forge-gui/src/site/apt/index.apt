Forge

  Forge lets you play the card game Magic: The Gathering against a computer opponent
  using all of the rules. This is very different than playing solitare Magic with Apprentice or Magic Workstation
  because the AI will attack and play spells. Currently there are over 8400 cards ranging from old power cards
  like Ancestral Recall and Lightning Bolt to newer cards like planeswalkers. The user interface is basic, but it
  does let you download all of the cards pictures and view them while playing the game.

  If you don't know Magic, the easiest way to learn is to download the demo and rulebook from
  {{{http://www.wizards.com/magic/TCG/NewtoMagic.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/newtomagic/learntoplay}here}}.
  You can also play sealed deck, draft, or the new quest mode. In draft mode the AI drafts for the 7 other
  opponents and builds the decks from the cards that it chooses. In the quest mode you start out with a few cards
  and the more games that you play the more that you win. As you get more cards you can update and change your
  deck.

  There is also a "quest mode" where you start out with a small, random cardpool and you win more cards by playing
  against opponents. This is a scaled down version of Shandalar that is only menu based. On easy mode your goal is
  to win 10 matches. Easy mode is well easy because you always win cards after the match whether you win or lose.
  On some of the harder modes you only win cards if you win. Quest mode is challenging since the computer uses
  cards that are better than the stinky ones that you have. The computer opponents are divided into three
  categories so they get progressively harder.

  Forge supports a number of keywords such as exalted, fear, flying, shadow, flanking, protection, wither, flash,
  defender, reach, and haste. Forge now also has a mana pool and supports creature enchantments.

  Forge runs on Windows, Linux, and OSX. You can download Forge from
