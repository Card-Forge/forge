Release Notes
-------------

- New Commander 2014 and KTK cards -
We have added a branch to our SVN for the new cards that are currently being scripted. These cards are not yet available in this build of forge. Please be patient and they will soon become available.


- Boolean Expressions -
You can now filter cards with simple boolean expressions. Forge automatically detects when you want to use one, so just start typing away in the search box.
This is a completely optional feature and will not change the way you use the search function in Forge, unless you specifically intend to use it.

As an example,
    "warrior" || "cleric"
will find all cards with the type of either "warrior" or "cleric" (when just the type search is enabled).

You can also use an AND operator to find cards with specific mana costs:
    "g" && "w"
will find all cards with both green and white mana symbols.

You can then construct large and very specific expressions to find exactly what you need:
    ("human" || "cat") && ("warrior" || "cleric" || "soldier")
will find all humans or cats that are also warriors, clerics, or soldiers.

More improvements are on their way in the next version of Forge, including removing the need for quotation marks and adding NOT operators. 


- Continued Work on Conspiracy -
Conspiracy is one of the strangest sets that have been released in some time. Currently, we have a few of the "Draft matters" cards scripted, although you'll find that they won't quite be available to you (unless you add them manually into a draft deck). Hopefully we'll get the appropriate functionality in so we can start including them in boosters and allowing you to add Conspiracy type cards straight to your deck the way you do every other variant card. We'll make sure to point out when all of these kinks have worked themselves out.

Known Issues
------------

- The Mac OS application version -
We can now package Forge as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process.

The Mac OS X app version apparently requires the Mavericks OS and is not compatible with earlier OS X versions. People with earlier OS X versions should use the Windows and Linux version and launch forge on their Mac by double clicking on the included "forge.command" file.

- Magic 2015 cards -
It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Conspiracy cards -
Forge now includes many of the new Conspiracy cards. It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Commander 2013 cards -
It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient.

- Born of the Gods cards -
It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient.

There is a known issue with the timing of Leaves the Battlefield triggers and multiple permanents Leaving the Battlefield. As an example, when Blood Artist died at the same time as a lot of other creatures due to a Wrath of God, the Blood Artist should trigger for every creature but does not do so.

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there is one remaining issue that we hope will be addressed in the near future:
Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
