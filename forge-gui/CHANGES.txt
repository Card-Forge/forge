Release Notes
-------------

- Add Basic Lands in desktop version of the game -
Forge now has an "Add Basic Lands" window (can be found in the deck editor next to the Main Deck/Sideboard toggle) which allows you
to easily and quickly add the needed basic lands (from any set you like and with any art you prefer) to your deck. This functionality
works in all major modes (Constructed, Booster Draft, Sealed Deck) including Quest mode.


- Quest mode changes related to basic lands -
Now that Add Basic Lands can be used to add basic lands to your deck, Quest mode underwent several changes to adapt to this new
functionality. In particular:
- Quest mode now depends on the player using Add Basic Lands to add basic lands to his decks instead of buying basic lands from the quest shop or using the generated basic lands from the initial card pool.
- Basic lands added in Quest mode using "Add Basic Lands" cannot be sold (and are not shown in the Quest Spell Shop interface) to avoid cheating.
- Quest mode no longer generates basic lands for the starting card pool to avoid clutter.
- Quest mode shop no longer sells basic lands (to avoid clutter; you can add any basic lands you want anyway).
- Quest mode draft tournament correctly allows to use "Add Basic Lands" only after drafting is over and deck construction begins (and the button is hidden during the drafting process).
- Otherwise, basic lands found normally during the quest (e.g. found in booster packs, drafted in quest draft tournaments (if anyone ever drafts basic lands), purchased in preconstructed decks etc.) function as before and can be sold normally via the quest shop interface.


- Permanent locations for Net Decks and Achievement trophies -
All Net Deck categories should now find decks and won't stop returning decks when new decks are added
A new "Download Achievement Images" button has been added to Content Downloaders for downloading awesome trophies for each achievement.


- Advanced Search in Card and Deck managers -
"Filter" button replaced with smaller button with search icon
When click, Add Filter > Advanced... will open Advanced Search dialog which will allow configuring an advanced search filter using any combination of filter options and operators, connected in an easy to build boolean expression.


- Keyboard shortcuts for Auto Yield -
There are two new keyboard shortcuts now that can be used to quickly set up an
auto-yield for the current ability on stack without having to use the mouse. 
By default the shortcuts are:
- "Y" enables auto-yield and, if applicable, enables "Always Yes" (if the trigger
is optional).
- "N" enables auto-yield and, if applicable, enables "Always No" (if the trigger
is optional).
The shortcuts can be changed in the Preferences under Game Settings in the main
Forge menu. 


- New Battle for Zendikar cards -
We have added a branch to our SVN for the new cards that are currently being scripted. These cards are not yet available in this build of forge. Please be patient and they will soon become available.


- Network play (BETA) -
This version of Forge includes a preliminary version of peer-to-peer (P2P)
network support. If one player hosts, other players can connect to that
player's machine by filling out the corresponding IP address and port number
(default 36743), provided the lobby contains one or more open player slots.
Do not expect network support to work reliably yet, any bug reports or other
comments are welcome!

Known Issues
------------

- Magic Origins -
Forge now includes many of the new Magic Origins cards. It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Dragon Presence cards from DTK -
Work has started on the Dragon Presence cards. These cards should typically work on their own merits, but a few corner cases dealing with copying/cloning may not work as expected. As these cases are fairly limited, it was decided to add these cards for people to be able to use.

- Dragons of Tarkir -
Forge now includes many of the new Dragons of Tarkir cards. It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Fate Reforged cards -
Forge now includes many of the new Fate Reforged cards. It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Commander 2014 cards -
Forge now includes many of the new Commander 2014 cards. It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient.

- New Khans of Tarkir cards -

The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Continued Work on Conspiracy -
Conspiracy is one of the strangest sets that have been released in some time. Currently, we have a few of the "Draft matters" cards scripted, although you'll find that they won't quite be available to you (unless you add them manually into a draft deck). Hopefully we'll get the appropriate functionality in so we can start including them in boosters and allowing you to add Conspiracy type cards straight to your deck the way you do every other variant card. We'll make sure to point out when all of these kinks have worked themselves out.

- The Mac OS application version -
We can now package Forge as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process.

The Mac OS X app version apparently requires the Mavericks OS and is not compatible with earlier OS X versions. People with earlier OS X versions should use the Windows and Linux version and launch forge on their Mac by double clicking on the included "forge.command" file.

- Magic 2015 cards -
It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient.

There is a known issue with Kodama of the Center Tree: its Soulshift X ability used to crash Forge, and until a proper fix can be implemented, a temporary fix was introduced which prevents the crash but makes the Soulshift X ability work incorrectly in certain cases (in particular, it doesn't work correctly with mass removal, and it may have issues when Kodama of the Center Tree is controlled by someone else other than its owner). In the basic cases (such as Kodama of the Center Tree being destroyed in combat or with a direct damage spell) should work correctly. Hopefully one of the developers will be able to implement a better and proper fix for this card soon.

There is a known issue with the cost reduction for cards that have color-locked X in their mana cost (e.g. Drain Life, Soul Burn). Cost reduction will not apply correctly to these cards if the amount by which the cost is reduced is greater than the amount of colorless mana in the mana cost specified on the card (e.g. 1 for Drain Life, 2 for Soul Burn). Fixing this issue likely requires rewriting the way announced color-locked X is interpreted and paid (most likely it has to be represented with colorless mana shards but still locked to the colors required by the card).

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there is one remaining issue that we hope will be addressed in the near future:
Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
