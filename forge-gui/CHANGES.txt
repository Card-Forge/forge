Release Notes
-------------

- Improved Commander support -
There will no longer be a black rectangle for "Commander effect" in the command zone.
The details previously available by hovering over that rectangle will now appear when hovering over the commander itself.
The dialog for the commander replacement effect will now display the commander's name.


- Momir Basic variant type -
Momir Basic is now available as its own variant option on the Constructed screen
For this format. each player will automatically be given a deck with 12 of each basic land and the Momir Vig avatar


- Choose value for X mana costs -
Now, when playing spells/abilities with X in its mana cost, you will now be prompted for a value for X prior to mana payment, ensuring the final mana cost is calculated properly from cost adjustment effects and allowing using the "Auto" button to pay the entire cost.
This also applies to spells with Replicate and Multikicker to allow picking the Replicate or Multikicker amount prior to paying the final mana cost.

- Auto-targeting support -
When playing spells and abilities with the text "target opponent", if you only have one opponent, you will no longer be asked to choose the opponent to target.
When triggered abilities have only one valid target, that target will now be auto-selected.

- AI improvements -
Some artificial intelligence improvements were made in this version of Forge. In particular, the AI will now try to predict if it wants to cast a spell in Main 2 and reserve some mana for it instead of aggressively pumping creatures. The AI will now also prefer to pump a creature if it can predict that this creature will deal more damage to the opponent with its increased power. The AI will no longer waste equipment on cards that are useless (e.g. are tapped and do not normally untap, or can't attack or block anymore). Also, the AI can now optionally move equipment from one creature to another. For this purpose, a new AI profile variable was added: MOVE_EQUIPMENT_TO_BETTER_CREATURES. It defines whether the AI will always move equipment to better creatures if it has mana ('always'), only move if the currently equipped creature becomes useless as defined above ('from_useless_only'), or never moves equipment around ('never'). The "Default" profile is set to never move equipment around. Reckless AI profile always moves equipment to better creatures when given a chance to (if it has mana and if it doesn't need to reserve mana for a future spell in Main 2), while Tricky AI only moves equipment to other creatures if the currently equipped creatures become useless (as defined above).


- New Commander 2014 and Khans of Tarkir cards -
We have added a branch to our SVN for the new cards that are currently being scripted. These cards are not yet available in this build of forge. Please be patient and they will soon become available.

- Continued Work on Conspiracy -
Conspiracy is one of the strangest sets that have been released in some time. Currently, we have a few of the "Draft matters" cards scripted, although you'll find that they won't quite be available to you (unless you add them manually into a draft deck). Hopefully we'll get the appropriate functionality in so we can start including them in boosters and allowing you to add Conspiracy type cards straight to your deck the way you do every other variant card. We'll make sure to point out when all of these kinks have worked themselves out.

- The Mac OS application version -
We can now package Forge as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process.

The Mac OS X app version apparently requires the Mavericks OS and is not compatible with earlier OS X versions. People with earlier OS X versions should use the Windows and Linux version and launch forge on their Mac by double clicking on the included "forge.command" file.

- Magic 2015 cards -
It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Conspiracy cards -
Forge now includes many of the new Conspiracy cards. It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

- Commander 2013 cards -
It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button.

- Born of the Gods cards -
It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button.

There is a known issue with the timing of Leaves the Battlefield triggers and multiple permanents Leaving the Battlefield. As an example, when Blood Artist died at the same time as a lot of other creatures due to a Wrath of God, the Blood Artist should trigger for every creature but does not do so.

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there is one remaining issue that we hope will be addressed in the near future:
Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
