Release Notes
-------------

- Constructed mode -
Recently a change was made to the constructed mode and this change now allows you to have up to 8 players rather than just two. The game formats that are located in the variants mode also allow up to eight players. The current user interface for this feature is fairly basic and is not very attractive. The settings tab allows you to set the number of opponents. The player tabs includes the same options that you used to see in the constructed mode.

Marc recently sketched out a couple of attractive mockups that look far more attractive than what we were using till recently and are currently redesigning. The initial implementation of a new, more advanced, intuitive and better looking Constructed mode lobby screen is now available. It is a work in progress, so you should expect some rough edges and missing functionality, but the lobby screen is functional enough so it's possible to choose decks and player types and start the match normally.
The ongoing discussion of this feature can be found in the following thread:

- Support for multiple card art -
Forge now fully supports the distinction between cards with different art, which is most apparent with basic lands. It is now possible to specifically add cards with particular art in the deck editor, and cards with different art are now generated for random constructed decks, sealed deck pools, booster draft extra basic land pools, starting quest card pools, and quest card shop pools. The deck file (.dck) format has been adapted to account for this change so that the card art index can now be specified after the set, with the index starting at 1 for the first possible card art. In case you would like to avoid generating cards with random art in limited modes (sealed deck, booster draft, quest mode) in order to make your deck management easier when it comes to basic lands, you can uncheck the "Randomize Card Art in Generated Card Pools" option in the game preferences. When disabled, the generated limited mode card pools will feature one kind of each basic land with the same picture on all cards.


- Commander 2013 cards -
Forge now includes many of the new Commander 2013 cards. It may take a few days/weeks before these new card pictures become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Card Pictures" button. The LQ set pictures tend to take a few more weeks/months to process before they become available for downloading via the "Download LQ Set Pictures" button. Please be patient. The Forge devs are not involved in maintaining the servers that house these pictures.

Known Issues
------------

There is a known issue with the timing of Leaves the Battlefield triggers and multiple permanents Leaving the Battlefield. As an example, when Blood Artist died at the same time as a lot of other creatures due to a Wrath of God, the Blood Artist should trigger for every creature but does not do so.

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there is one remaining issue that we hope will be addressed in the near future:
Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
