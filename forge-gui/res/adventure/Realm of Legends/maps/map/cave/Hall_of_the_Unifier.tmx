&quot;text&quot;: &quot;Congratulations on completing the Realm of Legends! You can now continue exploring this world if you wish - the Mirror Gallery you can now access contains difficult post-game challenges. You can also use new game plus to experience the adventure again. You'll keep your cards and non-key items, but lose all life upgrades and all enemies will respawn. You can also choose a new difficulty. More content may be added in the future, but just dungeons here and there; this is the only planned 'main story'.&quot;,

        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The mysterious mage who you've seen many times before stands before you. He lowers his hood as he addresses you. 

'Look familiar, {var=player_name}? This hall is what I modeled the library where you arrived after. It felt fitting to have new entrants to this world begin somewhere that was so similar to its exit. I imagine you have a lot of questions, like why I was helping you, and what I'm doing here.'&quot;,

                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;So, care to explain?&quot;,
                &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Well, I am Jodah the Unifier, the accidental architect of this realm of legends. It was a foolish idea, in truth - to weave a spell to bring about multiversal peace using the mana of an entire plane to fuel it. I thought my thousands of years of magical study would be enough to weave such a complex enchantment but alas, I've never been able to shake my hubris even after all these milennia.&quot;,

                        &quot;text&quot;: &quot;The spell I cast essentially had the opposite of its intended effect, driving all of time and space's most powerful figures into violent madness. Its why you've met so many eager to fight to the death at a moment's notice. I managed to trap all the affected legends here so that the consequences of my mistake would be confined to a single plane. That, at least, worked well.&quot;,
                        &quot;options&quot;: [
                            {

                                &quot;text&quot;: &quot;I knew I wouldn't be able to contain the greatest of the legends I trapped here forever. So I decided to call on planeswalkers like you to try and rid this world of the beings most likely to be able to break free of this world. Hence why I hid the keys to this exit behind the task of slaying the most powerful legends.&quot;,
