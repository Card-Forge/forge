  cards you want in the Card List (one per line). The Card list can contain either a few spare cards, \
  or a full deck in one of the most popular M:TG formats (Please see below the list of supported Deck formats). \n \
  Each line in the Card list is processed immediately, and any recognized entry will appear in the Decklist in one \
  of the following colors: {0}
lblGuideImportCard=Card successfully recognized and ready to be imported.
lblGuideWarnMessage=Unknown or Limited Card (i.e. Banned or Restricted), or general warning message.

lblGuideTipsTitleCount=Card Amount
lblGuideTipsCount={0}: Prepend to each card line the number of copies to import (default: 1). \n\
  For example, both {1} and {2} are accepted entries.
lblGuideTipsTitleSet=Card Art
lblGuideTipsSet={0}: Specify the code of an M:TG set (right before or right after card name) to choose a \
  specific card art. Also add card collector number or the art index at the end of the line, if the chosen \
  set has multiple arts for the same card (See more examples below).
lblGuideTipsTitleFoil=Foil Cards
lblGuideTipsFoil={0}: Any card name ending with the "+" sign will be imported foiled, e.g. {1}. Alternatively, \
  appending the {2} symbol at the end of card line (as it is customary in some M:TG deck formats) will \
  do the same (Please see the Examples Section below).
lblGuideTipsTitlePlaceholder=Card Groups
lblGuideTipsPlaceholder={0}: Special placeholder keywords can be used to organize the Card list. They can be either \
  Core Card Types (e.g. {1}), Card Rarity (i.e. {2}), Mana Cost (e.g. {3}), or Mana Colors (e.g. {4}).
lblGuideTipsTitleDeckSections=Deck Sections
lblGuideTipsDeckSection={0}: Similar to Card Groups, the Card list can also be organized in Deck Sections \
  (e.g. {1}), that will also used by the Importer to assign cards in the deck (default: {2}). \
  For this reason, the Importer also integrates an automated validation of cards in sections to \
  reduce the risk of errors.
lblGuideTipsTitleDeckName=Deck Name
lblGuideTipsDeckName={0}: Assign a name to your Deck. Just type "Deck:" or "Name:", followed by the name \
  to assign to the deck.
lblGuideTipsTitleDeckFormat=Deck Formats
lblGuideTipsDeckFormats={0}: Several M:TG deck formats are supported: MTG Arena; \
  MTGO, XMage, MTG Goldfish (all export); TappedOut (all export, but CSV); DeckStats.net; ".dec" files.
nlGuideExamplesTitle=Examples
lblExample1=10x Islands+ MIR 2
nlExample1=10 FOIL "Island" from Set "Mirage", Art Index 2\.
lblExample2=4 Darksteel Citadel (M15) 242
nlExample2=4 "Darksteel Citadel" from "M15", Collector Nr. "242".\n\n \
  This is an exemplar entry in MTGArena format as exported by TappedOut.
lblExample3=18 Forest &lt;254&gt; [THB] (F)
nlExample3=18 FOIL "Forest" from "THB", Collector Nr. "254".\n\n \
  This is an exemplar entry in MTGArena deck format as exported by MTGGoldfish. \
  The "(F)" in the end denotes a foil card, and the Collector Number in angular brackets is \
  is used to select a specific Card Art).
lblExample4=4x TMP|Counterspell
nlExample4=4 copies of "Counterspell" from "Tempest".\n\n \
  In this entry, the Set code is specified before the card name using the (optional) pipe separator.\
  Alternative valid separators for set codes are braces, brackets, and parenthesis.
lblExample5=SB: 2 [M19:28] Mighty Leap
nlExample5=2 copies of "Mighty Leap" from "M19", Collector Nr. "28" to be added in "Sideboard".\n\n \
  This is an exemplar entry in XMage deck format. In this format, the Set code and the Collector Number are \
  column-separated, and specified in brackets right before card name. \
  Moreover, an optional Prefix (i.e. SB:) is used to denote the Deck Section where the card should be added to. \
  The Deck Importer in Forge further extends this idea by also adding support to two extra prefixes, i.e. "MB:" and \
  "CM:" as for "Main" and "Commander" Section, respectively.
