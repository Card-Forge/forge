Oracle:Suspend 4—{1}{U} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {1}{U} and exile it with four time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, you may cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)\nWhen the last time counter is removed from Veiling Oddity while it's exiled, creatures can't be blocked this turn.
