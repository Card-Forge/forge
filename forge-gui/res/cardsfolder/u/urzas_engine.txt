Oracle:Trample\n{3}: Urza's Engine gains banding until end of turn. (Any creatures with banding, and up to one without, can attack in a band. Bands are blocked as a group. If any creatures with banding you control are blocking or being blocked by a creature, you divide that creature's combat damage, not its controller, among any of the creatures it's being blocked by or is blocking.)\n{3}: Attacking creatures banded with Urza's Engine gain trample until end of turn.
