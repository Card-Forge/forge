# TODO: If shared turns are ever implemented that are needed for proper E01 support, this would need to be updated to ensure
# that several opponents may choose to tap a total of 8 power creatures, as opposed to one opponent fully paying the cost.
# Ideally, UnlessCost should be expanded to support tapXType<Any/Creature.YouCtrl+withTotalPowerGE8> cost, which would allow
# to also get rid of the complex script part below and the AILogic$ BowToMyCommand hack in AiController#chooseCardsForEffect
