Oracle:Deep-Sea Kraken can't be blocked.\nSuspend 9â€”{2}{U} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {2}{U} and exile it with nine time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)\nWhenever an opponent casts a spell, if Deep-Sea Kraken is suspended, remove a time counter from it.
