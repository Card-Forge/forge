Oracle:Colorless spells you cast from your hand with mana value 7 or greater have “Cascade, cascade.” (When you cast one, exile cards from the top of your library until you exile a nonland card that costs less. You may cast it without paying its mana cost. Put the exiled cards on the bottom of your library in a random order. Then do it again.)
