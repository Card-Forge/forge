Oracle:At the beginning of your upkeep, choose an opponent at random. Exile the top card of that playerâ€™s library. Until end of turn, you may play that card and you may spend mana as though it were mana of any color to cast it. When you cast a spell this way, its owner loses life equal to its mana value.
