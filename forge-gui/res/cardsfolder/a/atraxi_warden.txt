Oracle:Flying\nWhen Atraxi Warden enters the battlefield, exile up to one target tapped creature.\nSuspend 5—{1}{W} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {1}{W} and exile it with five time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
