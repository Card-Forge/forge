Description=The ability to cross over the barriers between realms is a deadly advantage in battle, and few know that better than Ranar. As a Spirit guardian and your commander, he'll send a Spirit to aid your cause every time you exile something. So take advantage of your creatures' powerful "enters-the-battlefield" abilities by blinking them in and out of existence, or open a tear in the fabric of reality and shove your opponents' most potent threats through itâ€”either way, Ranar will be there, calling forth yet another Spirit to help you on your way to victory.
