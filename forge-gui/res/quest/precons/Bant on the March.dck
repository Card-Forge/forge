Name=Bant on the March
Description=Now you can answer that call to war. You'll assemble a quick force of heroic soldiers, rhoxes, and flying aven to defend the noble realm of Bant from the other planes. Then you can continue the attack one of two ways: build up a single, unstoppable champion using the exalted mechanic, or overrun your enemy with a game-ending spell that empowers your whole army at once. Nothing will stand between you and glorious victory.
