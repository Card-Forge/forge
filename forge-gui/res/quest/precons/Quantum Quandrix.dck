Description=Amid the mana-rich waters of the Pinzari Isles, the twins Adrix and Nev grew up literally swimming in magic. At an early age, they began to see patterns in the tides and currents that eluded even the most esteemed scholars of their society. Once, they saved a hundred lives by predicting the sudden arrival of a tsunami despite the deceptively calm seas. After that, any doubts about their prowess were washed away. At Strixhaven, they received special permission to teach as a duo, blending mastery of blue and green mana. They constantly debate the merits of various esoteric mathematical principles, but if one of their students is in danger, they leap into action in perfect harmony.
