Name=Endless March
Description=For the creatures in the Endless March deck, the battle never endsâ€”and they wouldn't have it any other way. This deck revolves around the interaction of vanishing and "rescue." It's an ideal match: When a vanishing creature gets low on time counters, play a rescue creature and return it to your hand. You can replay it fully restocked with time counters!
Deck Type=constructed
Set=PLC
