Name=Hope's Crusaders
Description=Nothing—not even an apocalypse—can keep a noble fighter down, and the "Hope's Crusaders" deck is proof of that. Lead your troops onto the battlefield and give them the one command they want to hear: "Charge!" This deck gives your opponent no good blocking options: Either your creatures will get through, or your opponent's blockers will be overmatched in combat.
Deck Type=constructed
Set=TSP
