Description=Magic: The Gathering is set in the imaginary worlds of Dominia, where powerful wizards battle for control of the landscape. The rival twin wizards, Kazz and Zakk, will lead you through your first game of Magic. Powerful creatures and spells are at your disposal, which you use to reduce your opponent's 20 life to zero. If you accomplish this first, you've won the game!
