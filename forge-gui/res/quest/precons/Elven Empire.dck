Description=Hailing from a time before the wood and shadow elves were split apart, Lathril represents the glory that the elves hope to return to. Unafraid to wade into the battle personally, she often fought at the head of her forces, dealing death in all directions and rallying her troops to turn even crushing defeat into defiant victory. Some elves believe that her consciousness lingers in one of the Jaspera trees and pray to her faithfully in anticipation of the return of the Einir, the old elven gods who could unite the wood and shadow elves once again.
