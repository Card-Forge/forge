Description=Elected as "Harvesttide Sovereign" by the witches of the Dawnhart Coven, Leinore has thrown a festival for the ages. Her hard work has filled both the witches and townsfolk of Innistrad with hopeâ€”perhaps this long night will soon see daybreak. Leinore hands out +1/+1 counters to everyone on her guest list. At the end of the night, your horde of humans will be the last ones standing.
