Name=Nuts and Bolts
Description=Small, inexpensive artifacts have been staples of the Magic game since its earliest days, but the Fifth Dawn expansion boosts their usefulness to another level. Cards like Auriok Salvagers and Leonin Squire bring cheap artifacts back from your graveyard and apply early attacking pressure. With sixteen artifacts that cost {1} or less, the Nuts and Bolts deck takes full advantage of your creatures' scavenging abilities.
