Title=The Plague
Difficulty=easy
Description="My lord, there is only so much I can do. This plague infests Krov worse than any other city." -Halvor Arensson, Kjeldoran Priest

Krov was the capital city of the kingdom of Kjeldor on Terisiare in Dominaria near the last five hundred years of the Ice Age. Once a center of learning famed for its elementalist wizards, it was ravaged by plagues after the World Spell triggered the Thaw, creating a warmer climate in which disease proliferated.
