Title=The Cosmos Monsters
Difficulty=medium
Description=Magical creatures known as Cosmos monsters live and thrive in the space between the realms. Most of them resemble a recognizable animal, such as a wolf or eagle, but grown to prodigious size and enhanced with mystical abilities and supernatural knowledge. The peoples of Kaldheim believe that when the Cosmos monsters were born, all the secrets of the world-including events that hadn't yet happened-were locked inside their minds. Mages from many realms, and even gods, have devoted their lives to unlocking those secrets.
