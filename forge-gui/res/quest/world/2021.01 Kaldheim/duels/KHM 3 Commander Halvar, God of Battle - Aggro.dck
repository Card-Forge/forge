Title=Commander: Halvar
Difficulty=hard
Description=Halvar is selfless, stalwart, unwavering, and always the most sensible person in any room. He's an accomplished warrior but is more likely to lead by example than with inspiring speeches. He speaks with a quiet confidence that leads most people to trust him instinctively, especially in times of crisis. Halvar considers himself the protector of the Skoti and acts as their self-appointed bodyguard on their adventures and exploits-even though he'd prefer to stay home.
