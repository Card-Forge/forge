Title=Bretagard: The Aldergard
Difficulty=easy
Description=The Aldergard is an ancient forest of pine, yew, and deciduous trees. The edges of the forest are sun-dappled and welcoming, but toward the center, the trees grow together into a seamless twilight canopy. The forest is home to the nomadic Kannah clan, who maintain temporary settlements in the forest but regularly send groups on exploratory expeditions. Some such expeditions even extend into other realms as the Kannah search tirelessly for a path to Starnheim. The Aldergard is so large that some Kannah wander for years without ever leaving the forest.
