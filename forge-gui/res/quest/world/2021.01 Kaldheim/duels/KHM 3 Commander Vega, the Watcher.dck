Title=Commander: Vega
Difficulty=hard
Description=A spy for the gods, Vega is a spirit owl who spends most of her time in the roots of the World Tree near the Gods' Hall. After Valki tricked Toralf into dragging the Hall across the realms, the gods really weren't keen on having it happen again. Should anything abnormal happen here, Vega would immediately report to Kolvori.
