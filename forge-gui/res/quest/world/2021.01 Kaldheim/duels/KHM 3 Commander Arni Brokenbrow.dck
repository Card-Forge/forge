Title=Commander: Arni
Difficulty=hard
Description=The current leader of the Tuskeri clan was formerly known as Arni Goatleaper. When rumor of rampaging trolls reached the Tuskeri, all the warriors clamored for battle. Arni managed to track the trolls down. He knew he could not beat multiple trolls at once and decided to use something resembling cunning. He looked at the biggest, scariest troll and said, "I challenge you, son of a hairless piglet, to a headbutting contest." With a little bit of luck (and the blessings of the Tuskeri clerics) Arni came out on top. He found himself with a new title, leadership of the Tuskeri, and a souvenir permanently lodged in his skull.
