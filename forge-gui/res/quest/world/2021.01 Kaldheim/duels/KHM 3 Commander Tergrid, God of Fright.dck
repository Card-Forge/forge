Title=Commander: Tergrid
Difficulty=hard
Description=Tergrid's shadow has a terrifying life of its own. When she was four years old, it came to life and attempted to strangle her, but even as a young child she was able to battle it for days until she bent it to her will. Now it appears as a towering hooded figure that never speaks, looming behind her or occasionally wrapping its shadowy fingers around her neck. Tergrid pretends it isn't there and lashes out in anger at anyone who acknowledges its presence. Now she tries her best to live a normal life, despite the menacing figure that follows her everywhere.
