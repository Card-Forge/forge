Title=Commander: Jorn
Difficulty=hard
Description=Jorn is the god of weather. He knows the swiftest, safest paths across every realm (and between the realms), and he can read signs that are invisible to others. He can also talk with all animals, whose company he prefers over gods and humans alike, and often has one or two accompanying him on his travels.
