Title=Commander: Sigrid
Difficulty=hard
Description=Sigrid is the spiritual leader of the Beskir. Long ago, Sigrid's ancestor Hurrik saved the god Alrund's life. As thanks, Alrund gifted the whole of Feltmark to Hurrik and his descendants and gave them his protective blessing. Alrund's word remains true, and Sigrid carries the same blessing. When Sigrid was young, she was approached by a Cosmos Bear. It came to her but did not attack. It instead pressed its snout against her forehead, then returned to the forest from which it came. This was seen as a renewal of Alrund's pledge, a sign of the favor of the gods, and an endorsement of Sigrid's leadership.
