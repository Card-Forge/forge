Title=Commander: Cosima
Difficulty=hard
Description=Cosima does not live with the rest of the gods, but she comes back occasionally and is welcome to stay in the Gods' Hall as long as she likes. She and Alrund had three children (Toralf, Birgi, and Kolvori), and they lived together in the Gods' Hall for twenty years, which is still the longest she has ever stayed in one place. But she never stopped hearing the call of the sea, and eventually, she left the Hall to return from whence she came. The "Omenkeel", Cosima's longboat, is a magical vehicle that can carry its passengers through the Cosmos to any of the Ten Realms and a destination chosen by the goddess.
