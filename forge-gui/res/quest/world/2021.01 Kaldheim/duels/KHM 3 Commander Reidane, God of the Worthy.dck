Title=Commander: Reidane
Difficulty=hard
Description=Reidane is the God of Justice. Reidane is extremely zealous in her pursuit of, well, justice. Once she has made up her mind about an issue, she never wavers in her judgement. Her conception of justice revolves around "fairness," which to her means that every injustice must be paid in a sacrifice of equivalent value--including blood. This belief is echoed in the Code of the Clans of Bretagard and practiced by most of the human clans. Reidane willingly aids mortals who can convince her they are owed a blood debt that has not yet been paid, and she has special regard for the Beskir clan, whose founding leader once saved Alrund's life.
