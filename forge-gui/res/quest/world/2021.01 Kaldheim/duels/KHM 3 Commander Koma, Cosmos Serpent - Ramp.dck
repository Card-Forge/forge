Title=Commander: Koma
Difficulty=hard
Description=Most of the Cosmos monsters are free to enter any realm. But when the Skoti overthrew the Einir gods, they also prohibited the Cosmos Serpent they revered from entering any of the realms. Perhaps they feared that the immense serpent would eventually grow large enough that no realm could contain him. The elves, who continue to worship Koma, believe that his banishment harms the World Tree. Restless outside the realms, Koma's agitation is destabilizing the tree, causing a dangerous increase in Doomskars. Unless the Cosmos Serpent is free to roam the realms, the World Tree will surely die--and all the realms with it.
