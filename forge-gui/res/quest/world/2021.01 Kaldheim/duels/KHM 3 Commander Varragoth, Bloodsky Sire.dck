Title=Commander: Varragoth
Difficulty=hard
Description=The Skelle clan became the terrible force it is today under the tutelage of Varragoth, a demon who escaped from Immersturm. Once in Bretagard, he quickly established himself as the leader of the Skelle raiders. He led them to Beskir Hall, slaughtering anyone they found along the way. The gods stepped in and battled Varragoth for an entire month before finally wrestling him back to Immersturm and restoring the wards meant to keep demons bound there. Still trapped, Varragoth has not grown complacent. He intends to escape Immersturm and has nursed a grudge against the gods and Bretagard for a century.
