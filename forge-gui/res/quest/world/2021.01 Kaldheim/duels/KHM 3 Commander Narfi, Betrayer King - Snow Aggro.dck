Title=Commander: Narfi
Difficulty=hard
Description=Generations ago, Narfi was the king of Karfell. Narfi's father had signed a pact with the elves and was rewarded with a magical longship that could bring any number of people between realms. Narfi used the longship to ferry his army to new realms and raid at will. His wealth soon overflowed the Port of Marn, and his treasure and military became famous across the realms. Hundreds of years later, Narfi is still a cruel king driven by a lust for power and wealth.
