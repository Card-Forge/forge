Title=Commander: Svella
Difficulty=hard
Description=Most trolls aren't particularly smart, but Svella the Ice Shaper is different. She possesses magical abilities and a sophisticated love of art. An outcast from all troll clans, she wanders Gnottvold creating mystical sculptures out of ice. Her masterpiece is a replica of the standing stones of Karo Glade, imbued with a magic no other troll could understand. She is quite lonely and would like nothing more than to meet another art lover.
