Title=Commander: Fynn
Difficulty=hard
Description=The leader of the Kannah clan is renowned as the only human who has ever managed to wound the Cosmos Serpent. When Fynn stabbed the beast, the great serpent's poisonous blood splashed on him and was absorbed into his body--but rather than killing him, it turned his blood to poison as well. Now his body takes its own corrosive revenge against any enemy who successfully strikes him. As outrageously impossible as Fynn's tale might seem, he proudly carries a shield made from a single scale of the monstrous serpent.
