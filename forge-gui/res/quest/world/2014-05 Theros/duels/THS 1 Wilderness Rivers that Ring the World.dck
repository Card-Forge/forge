Name=THS 1 Wilderness: Rivers That Ring the World
Title=The Rivers That Ring the World
Difficulty=easy
Description=Cerberus have paws like half-molten stone, and they leave seared, smoking tracks as they walk. As a result, the land that borders the first of the Rivers That Ring the World is a blackened, smoldering wasteland. The nature and origins of the cerberus are unknown. Chimeras are the product of overambitious magecraft--the fusing of essences from three, four, or even five creatures to create a new and dangerous one. Some believe they are the product of Keranos's folly; that he "inspired" a mage with lightning, leaving the mage's mind damaged but impassioned in one stroke.
