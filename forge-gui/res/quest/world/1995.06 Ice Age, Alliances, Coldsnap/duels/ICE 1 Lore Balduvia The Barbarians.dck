Title=The Balduvian Barbarians
Difficulty=easy
Description="Peace will come only when we have taken Varchild's head." -Lovisa Coldeyes, Balduvian chieftain

Balduvia is a vast steppe of rocky plains due west of the city of Kjeld that is home to barbarians. Balduvian barbarians are mainly hunters, but keep a few more permanent settlements in the area. They were rivals of Kjeldor for some time, but allied with the forces of their enemies to battle against Lim-Dul. With the end of the Ice Age, many of the beasts that the barbarians hunted died out, and the land became suitable for crops. This marked a change in Balduvian lifestyles and further cemented their alliance with the Kjeldorans.
