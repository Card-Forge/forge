Name=ICE 1 Lore: The School of the Unseen: Gerda Aagesdotter
Title=Gerda Aagesdotter
Difficulty=easy
Description="Lat-Nam has bequeathed us its secrets. With them we shall attain true enlightenment." -Gerda Aagesdotter, Archmage of the Unseen

The School of the Unseen is a college of wizardry located on the western edge of Terisiare.  Formerly known as the City of Shadows, the school was formed from the remnants of the College of Lat-Nam after it was destroyed in the Brothers' War.  An enormous glacial wall now separates the peninsula of Lat-Nam from the rest of Terisiare.

The school was ruled by Archmage Eternal Jodah for thousands of years until a coup staged by Jodah's second-in-command Gerda Aagesdotter and Kjeldoran royal mage Gustha Ebasdotter has left Gerda in charge and Jodah in the hands of Lim-Dul, the necromancer.
