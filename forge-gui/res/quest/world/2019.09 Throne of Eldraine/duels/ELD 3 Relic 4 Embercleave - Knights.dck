Title=Relic: Embercleave
Difficulty=hard
Description=According to Embereth knights, the Irencrag will speak to aspiring knights in a voice only they can hear, often taunting them as a test of their courage. According to legend, it was this taunting that inspired Ianthe to be the first to impale the stone with her sword. Occasionally, when the Irencrag finds a knight particularly worthy, it will bestow their sword with a legendary name, forever imbuing it with its power.
