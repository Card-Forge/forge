Name=THS 1 Wilderness: Siren Sea
Title=The Siren Sea
Difficulty=easy
Description=The Siren Sea is home to the tritons, a race of sea-dwellers who can plague sailors and coastal poleis such as Meletis. Tritons are partially amphibious--they can breathe air for several days at a time but must spend time in water to keep their gills soft. While tritons pay respect to many gods, they are devoted to Thassa, god of the sea. Tritons see Thassa as the primary god of the pantheon of Theros, believing she will bring their race to ascendancy over beasts of the sea and the human-dominated poleis of the land.
