Title=The Nyxborn

Description=In his quest to propel himself to godhood, the satyr Planeswalker Xenagos began a series of mystical rituals. These rituals had an unanticipated side effect: the blurring of the lines between the realm of the gods and everyday existence. Creatures that used to dwell exclusively in Nyx began appearing in the mortal world. These beings born of the gods' starry domain are known as the "Nyxborn."
