Title=Axgard: The City of Eight Doors
Difficulty=easy
Description=The fabled dwarven City of Eight Doors can be accessed only through eight golden doors built into the mountainsides. No invaders from this realm or any other have ever breached the city; it is widely considered impregnable. Would-be raiders would have to cross miles of rugged mountains to even reach one of the entrances, and the doors are heavily warded against both magical and physical damage. Vast, gilded halls stretch for miles under the mountains and flatlands: feast-halls, immense rooms filled with exquisitely crafted weapons, and huge auditoriums where thousands of dwarves gather to hear the stories of their people.
