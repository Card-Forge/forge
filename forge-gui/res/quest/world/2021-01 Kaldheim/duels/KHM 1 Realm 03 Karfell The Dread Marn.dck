Title=Karfell: The Dread Marn
Difficulty=easy
Description=The draugr are an ancient race of undead lords and their subjects, animated by their pathological lust for wealth and power. Occasionally, the undead venture forth in their strange stone ships to raid other realms and bring back yet more wealth to add to their overflowing vaults. King Narfi maintains an army of raiders known as the Dread Marn. Whenever a Doomskar or Omenpath presents the opportunity, the Dread Marn pillage other realms in search of more treasure to add to Karfell's already packed treasure vaults.
