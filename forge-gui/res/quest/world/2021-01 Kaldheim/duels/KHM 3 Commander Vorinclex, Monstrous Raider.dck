Title=Commander: Vorinclex
Difficulty=hard
Description=Vorinclex is a praetor of New Phyrexia. He despises the concept of sentience and wants the multiverse to operate solely on the roles of predator and prey--survival of the fittest for all. Why Vorinclex arrived in Kaldheim is currently unknown, but the purposes are certainly nefarious. The method he used to travel between planes is also a mystery. Vorinclex's organic parts were destroyed in the journey, leaving only metal and bone. An inquisitive stag sniffing around his remains was enough raw material to begin crafting a new body, and Vorinclex made his way up the food chain until he had created a form he found satisfactory.
