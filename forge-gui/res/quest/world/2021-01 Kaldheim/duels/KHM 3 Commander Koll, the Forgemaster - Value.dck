Title=Commander: Koll
Difficulty=hard
Description=One day, Koll was attacked by a Cosmos Monster. He almost lost his life, but the god Halvar intervened and defeated the monster. Where the monster fell, Koll spotted a shining chunk of Tyrite. Koll ran to the material and touched it-transforming his hand into Tyrite itself. Koll discovered that his Tyrite hand was able to handle the godly material safely. Koll swore that he would forge the Tyrite into the finest blade the realms had ever seen as a gift for Halvar. He worked nonstop for days upon end before emerging from his forge with a blade so sharp it could cut a path between realms--a blade he called the Sword of the Realms.
