Title=Commander: Sarulf
Difficulty=hard
Description=The giant wolf Sarulf carved a swathe of destruction as he wandered the realms. Working together, the gods and the dwarves captured him on Axgard. Sarulf was trapped in a cavern and bound with eight magical chains. But his incessant howling was intolerable to the dwarves, and they demanded that the gods find another place to imprison the wolf. While he was being transported to Littjara, Sarulf escaped, and he now wanders free in the Cosmos.
