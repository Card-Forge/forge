Title=Commander: Toski
Difficulty=hard
Description=Toski is a mischievous squirrel who serves as a messenger for Esika, the god of the World Tree. Though he is tiny (especially compared with some of the other Cosmos monsters), he scampers with unbelievable speed along the World Tree to carry messages between realms. His small size allows him to observe events in all the realms and prize out secrets which he then carries back to Esika. Toski doesn't speak. He and Esika communicate by a mysterious form of telepathy, ensuring that the secrets Toski brings to the god remain exactly that.
