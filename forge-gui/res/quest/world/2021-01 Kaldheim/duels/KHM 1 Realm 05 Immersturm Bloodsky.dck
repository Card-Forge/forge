Title=Immersturm: Bloodsky
Difficulty=easy
Description=The Skelle from Bretagard clan became the terrible force it is today under the tutelage of Varragoth, a demon who escaped from Immersturm. Once in Bretagard, he quickly established himself as the leader of the Skelle raiders, who were all too happy to ally themselves with a demon. The gods, seeing the violence wrought by this intruder from another realm, stepped in and battled Varragoth for an entire month before finally wrestling him back to Immersturm and restoring the wards meant to keep demons bound there. On Bretagard, the winter season is still known as Bloodsky in memory of the massacre.
