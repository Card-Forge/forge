Title=Starnheim: The Reapers
Difficulty=easy
Description=Older than the Skoti, the Valkyries do not serve the gods. They were formed at the beginning of time, and they do not allow their judgment to be clouded by the petty squabbling that practically defines the nature of the gods. Valkyries carry out their missions of judgment in pairs, with a white-aligned shepherd and a black-aligned reaper traveling together. Black-aligned Valkyries are reapers of the cowardly. While a shepherd will wait for the death of a worthy person, reapers intervene when they witness cowardly deeds. Both Valkyries in a pair must agree on each fallen warrior's fate before it can be enacted.
