Title=Commander: Orvar
Difficulty=hard
Description=Orvar is one of the oldest and most experienced Covewalkers. Orvar has been around for such a long time that he has learned how to spread his physical form across multiple bodies. As long as he has a reference, he can create "copies" of an observed creature, although the copies are quite literally an extension of himself. Orvar's intentions are cloaked in mystery. He has spent centuries gathering both knowledge and new forms, but his end goals are unknown. Whenever an ancient tale involves a changeling, it is often secretly about Orvar himself.
