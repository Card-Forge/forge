Title=Commander: Aegar
Difficulty=hard
Description=Raised among the frost giants, Aegar didn't discover his fire giant ancestry until his powers manifested as an adolescent. He immediately set off on a pilgrimage for the fire giants to find and meet his estranged father. He was met with derision by some of the fire giants, but quickly earned his place by handily defeating those who disparaged him. After making a scene on his arrival, Kaldar came to investigate. A brief conversation revealed their relationship, and Kaldar was overjoyed to meet the son he didn't know he had.
