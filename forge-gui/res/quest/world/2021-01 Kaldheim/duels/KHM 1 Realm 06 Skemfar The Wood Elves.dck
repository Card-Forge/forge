Title=Skemfar: The Wood Elves
Difficulty=easy
Description=United in an uneasy alliance under a single king for the first time in generations, wood elves and shadow elves continue their struggle to regain their former power amid the primordial forests and vast mires of Skemfar. For all their differences, both factions of elves share a common reverence for the Cosmos Serpent and a common hope that they will one day restore themselves as the gods of Kaldheim.
