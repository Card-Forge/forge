Title=Commander: Egon
Difficulty=hard
Description=Egon is the god of death. He is one of the oldest Skoti, but he ages backward. He has the appearance (and the bitter, negative attitude) of a teenage boy. Caustic and pessimistic, he constantly predicts the downfall of the Skoti. Due to his youthful visage, the other gods sometimes fail to take him seriously, which is a source of bitter resentment for him. During the Skoti's war with the Einir, Egon tricked King Narfi, the king of Karfell, into giving him control of an army of the dead. This grisly gift turned the tide of battle in favor of the Skoti. In honor of this feat, he became god of all the dead and spends most of his time in Istfell among the spirits.
