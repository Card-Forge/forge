Title=Commander: Toralf
Difficulty=hard
Description=Toralf's power over thunder grants him the ability to call down a devastating blow upon his enemies, but he has no interest in waging war. Toralf has won renown for repeatedly doing the impossible. He plucked a hair off the head of Metar, the largest frost giant in Surtland. He carved his mark on the shell of the Chasm Beast that dwells in the deepest trench of Karfell's frigid ocean. He made two realms collide just by swinging his Tyrite hammer against the Skyfang Forge. Toralf is the eldest son of Alrund and Cosima, and his father thinks he is wasting his talents.
