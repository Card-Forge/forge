Title=Commander: Tyvar
Difficulty=hard
Description=Tyvar is King Harald's younger brother. He's determined that his own story will rival (or exceed) the tales of Kaldheim's greatest heroes. After an epic battle, he's just as likely to sing the praises of his allies as he is to brag about his own achievements (though you can be sure he'll do that, too). He's really a classic extrovert at heart who enjoys the camaraderie shared among warriors. He actively seeks out allies willing to fight by his side and share a drink (or three) to celebrate their glorious victory afterward.
