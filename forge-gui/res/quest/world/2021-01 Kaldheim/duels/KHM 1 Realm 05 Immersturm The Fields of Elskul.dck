Title=Immersturm: The Fields of Elskul
Difficulty=easy
Description=Immersturm is a land of fire, demons, and constant warfare. The gods have placed powerful runic wards around Immersturm to keep the demons trapped. Rival demon jarls come to battle each other on the bloodstained Fields of Elskul. Since the demons can't leave Immersturm, they have only each other to fight, and their insatiable bloodlust means that a massive battle is constantly raging on the black battlefields, day and night. Few combatants have any reason for fighting or any grudge against other demons; they simply battle for the battle's own sake.
