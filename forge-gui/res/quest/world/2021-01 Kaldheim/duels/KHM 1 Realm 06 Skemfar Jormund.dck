Title=Skemfar: Jormund
Difficulty=easy
Description=Skemfar looks like a vast expanse of unspoiled wilderness. In truth, elvish settlements are dotted across the landscape. A few of these settlements--where the wood elves and shadow elves live together, reunited under their new king--include both branch-lifted and root-sunk dwellings, reflecting the elves' intertwined destinies. The largest elf settlement is Jormund, an ancient city built when the elves were gods. Magic pervades the place, limning the branches with faerie glow in the perpetual twilight under the trees' high branches.
