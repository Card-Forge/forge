Difficulty=medium
Description="I know what you're thinking: 'Is this the one with the Dwarf Giants or the one with the Angel Berserker Elves?' Well, to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I've kinda lost track myself. But being this is a Maskwood Nexus, the most powerful artifact in Kaldheim, you've got to ask yourself one question: 'Do I feel lucky?' Well, do you, punk?"\n-Harry Callahan, Dirty Harry
