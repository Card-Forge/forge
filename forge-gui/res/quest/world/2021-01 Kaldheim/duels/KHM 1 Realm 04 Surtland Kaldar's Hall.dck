Title=Surtland: Kaldar's Hall
Difficulty=easy
Description=Fire giants are brutal and impulsive. They dwell in the lower elevations of Surtland where snow fields are divided by deep lava fissures. They live together in families and clans, building crude wooden structures from the realm's massive trees. Some also make their lairs in extensive cavern networks and lava tubes that run beneath the lowlands. Whenever a Doomskar brings Surtland into contact with another realm, fire giants are eager to launch raids. Kaldar is King of the Fire Giants.
