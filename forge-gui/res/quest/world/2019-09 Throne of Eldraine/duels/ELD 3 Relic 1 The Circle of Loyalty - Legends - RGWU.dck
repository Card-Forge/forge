Title=Relic: The Circle of Loyalty
Difficulty=hard
Description=The Circle of Loyalty imbues knights and mages of Ardenvale with the power to heal their allies and smite their enemies with holy fire. The magic of loyalty is stronger when cast in groups and forges an unseen bond between knights that innately empowers them to protect one another. Oaths that invoke the Circle are imbued with magical certainty, and any who would dare break such an oath are cast out of Ardenvale at once.
