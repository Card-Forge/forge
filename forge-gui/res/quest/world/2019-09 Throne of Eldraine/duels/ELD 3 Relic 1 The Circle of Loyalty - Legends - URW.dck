Title=Relic: The Circle of Loyalty
Difficulty=hard
Description=Legends say that in ancient times the woods had no borders and its wild growth stretched as far as the eye could see. The five relics that now form the centers of the courts were elvish treasures back then, and it's even possible that elf magic created some of them.
