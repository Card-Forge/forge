Difficulty=easy
Description=The heart land is home to the ruins of the old crown city of the lost elven dominion. Four pyramids guard its perimeter, each with a pair of obelisks on top. The Jade Bridge and the Obsidian Bridge cross the river that surrounds the heart realm. The Obsidian Bridge houses a deadly guardian. In the center is an amphitheater made out of the remains of a petrified dragon, where the Council of Druids meets. It is also the location for the Well of Ghosts and the Bridge of Regrets.
