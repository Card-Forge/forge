Title=Relic: Embercleave
Difficulty=hard
Description="Listen. Strange rocks lying in tournament grounds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical igneous ceremony. You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some fiery stone threw a sword at you!"\n-Dennis the Constitutional Peasant, Monty Python and the Holy Grail
