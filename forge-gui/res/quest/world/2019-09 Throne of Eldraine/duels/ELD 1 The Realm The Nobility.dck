Title=The Nobility
Difficulty=easy
Description="The last rulers of Castle Ardenvale favored their relatives and cronies. They turned their magic to petty, selfish, wicked purposes. They betrayed the virtues they should have upheld. That's how so many spurs of the Wilds were able to grow back into the countryside where they'd been eradicated long ago. We must hold ourselves to a higher standard, so the Wilds can't devour us because of our own faults and failures."\n-Queen Linden, Throne of Eldraine by Kate Elliott
