Name=MIR 2 Theme Deck: Savage Stompdown
Title=Savage Stompdown
Difficulty=medium
Description=In Jamuraa, the law of the jungle is "Eat or be eaten." Guess which side the "Savage Stompdown" deck is on? This unruly horde of Rhinos, Cheetahs, Elephants, Apes-as well as other not-so-natural animals-doesn't take kindly to intruders on their home turf, and is ready to do some turf invading of their own. It's time to go feral!
