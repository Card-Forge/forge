Release Notes
-------------

- Navigation tabs -
Forge now display navigation tabs in the titlebar and supports switching screens without closing them.
By default, Home and Deck Editor are available as tabs, with another closable tab added for any game you start.
X button in upper right now exits Forge rather than going back to Home screen.
To concede the current game, use the X button in the Game tab itself.
Deck Editor and Exit Forge buttons have been removed from the Home screen since they're both accessible on the titlebar.


- True Full Screen support -
Full Screen is now toggled using F11 and has its own button on the title bar.
Maximize will no longer pretend to be Full Screen by covering up the taskbar.
When in Full Screen mode, the titlebar will be hidden unless you move the mouse to the top of the screen.
A "Lock/Unlock" Title Bar button will be available in Full Screen mode to toggle whether the title bar should remain visible at all times.
When in Full Screen mode, a clock will appear to the left of the "Lock/Unlock Title Bar" button.
The title bar will appear on top of other components if not locked rather than pushing anything down.
The title bar will remain visible while accessing the Forge menu.


- Window fixes -
Minimize no longer crashes on Mac
Message and Input dialogs now appear properly centered and on top of main Forge window.
Prompt to save in Deck Editor (if unsaved changes) when using Forge > Restart.


- Introducing the Forge button -
The old menu bar has been removed.
The Forge button on the left side of the titlebar will drop down the same menu of options.
The Alt and Menu keys will also open this menu (even if the titlebar is hidden), with full keyboard navigation of the menus then possible.
The titlebar, minimize, maximize, and close buttons have all been increased in height to make room for the Forge button.
Menu items have been increased in height to make them more touch screen friendly. They also now enforce a minimum 100px width.
F1 has been changed to launch the Forge wiki since it no longer needs to toggle menu bar visibility.


- Forge now requires Java 7 -
Please update your Java runtime environment. At this point Forge versions 1.4.2 and above will no longer run under Java 6. Those who are using Mac OS should install the JDK version rather than the JRE version.


- The Mac OS X application -
At this time Forge now requires Java 7 and will no longer run under Java 6.

Unfortunately, the Mac OS X builder that we were using does not support Java 7. We hope to find and to use a different Mac OS X builder in order to continue releasing a Mac OS bundled application like we have in the past.

Currently, the windows/unix release of Forge includes a launcher file named "forge.command". Double click on the "forge.command" launcher command file and this will in turn launch the Forge jar file via the terminal application while increasing the Java heap space. This should be a temporary inconvenience.

Known Issues
------------

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there is one remaining issue that we hope will be addressed in the near future:
Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
