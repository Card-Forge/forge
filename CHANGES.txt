Release Notes
-------------

- Constructed Mode decks can now be stored in subfolders -
The feature is half-complete now. Forge can read subfolders in constructed deck, you may start game with such deck, but cannot yet edit decks in subfolders nor manipulate subfolders.


=== Forge now has a Menubar ===
- Toggle visibility using the F1 key. 
- The Forge menu contains Exit and Restart options. 
- The Layout menu contains the selector for the various themes and a Set Window Size option. 
- The Help menu contains links to online articles and the local TXT files.

=== Duel/Match Screen Changes ===
== Menubar Changes ==
- Migration of Dock and DevMode options into Menubar.
- Toggle console tabs visibility.
- Toggle background image.
- Toggle sound effects.
== Game Log Console ==
- Scrollbar is now hidden by default. Click console to toggle visibility.
== Prompt Console ==
- Fixed: Prevent buttons from disappearing off screen as the console size is decreased.
== Card Preview Console ==
- Fixed: now adheres to Scale Image Larger setting.

=== General GUI ===
== Themes ==
- Combo-box style should now be appear correctly on Mac OS .

- Forge now requires Java 7 -
Please update your Java runtime environment. At this point Forge versions 1.4.2 and above will no longer run under Java 6.


- The Mac OS X application -
At this time Forge now requires Java 7 and will no longer run under Java 6.

Unfortunately, the Mac OS X builder that we were using does not support Java 7. We hope to find and to use a different Mac OS X builder in order to continue releasing a Mac OS bundled application like we have in the past.

Currently, the windows/unix release of Forge includes a launcher file named "forge.command". Double click on the "forge.command" launcher command file and this will in turn launch the Forge jar file via the terminal application while increasing the Java heap space. This should be a temporary inconvenience.

Known Issues
------------

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there is one remaining issue that we hope will be addressed in the near future:
Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
