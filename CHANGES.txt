We have changed the archiving format to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these archives.


The Mac OS application version:

We have packaged the Forge 0#-##-2011 BETA version as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process.

You can move a copy of your pictures and decks over to the Forge.app application. Right click or control click on the Forge.app icon. Select Show Package Contents form the contextual menu. A Finder window will open and will display a folder named Contents. Navigate to the folder:

/Contents/Resources/Java/res/

Your decks can be placed in the decks folder, your pics can be placed in the pics folder, etc.


Fixes/Features:

- Added missing image for SplashFrame.
- Fixed typo in Stone-Seeder Hierophant. now untaps for landfall.
- Cleared out the changes.txt file, is ready for new material.
- Added link to releases.
- Updated to latest launch4j maven plugin.
- Supressed checkstyle error if there is a trailing space after a javadoc comment.
- Renamed splash pic. Spaces in the filename are not best practice.
- Renamed splash pic.
- Renamed splashpic.
- Fixed Matsu-Tribe Sniper to trigger on noncombat damage as well.
- Added the recent commit logs to changes.txt.
- Added the new Swan 2 deck to quest mode.
- Match on empty line with trailing space.
- Removed compiler warning from forge.deck.generate.Generate5ColorDeck.
- Issue 77: Avoid NPE when choosing cards at random for quests.
- Added RememberTokens script key to Token AF.
- Removed Adium depedency. modify other dmg scripts.
- Ran set info script.
- Added the recent commit logs to changes.txt.
- Added the LQ pic URL for Chandra, the Firebrand.
- Issue 117: Load from default display_layout.xml when user's customized display_new_layout.xml does not exist. Updated the default display_layout.xml to look good on a Windows XP 1024x768 display. Updated GuiDisplay4.java to load from default layout if user's "new" layout does not exist. We have not had display_new_layout.xml in the repository for some time, but that is a related change.
- Refactored QuestMatchState. GameInfo is renamed to GameSummary and is now an observer for game state. It's purpose is now to hold statistic data on game and actions performed by players. The former functionality moved to ColorChanger and Phase (all combat damage prevention due to Fog spell). Since then game turns calculation is done properly (no need to add/substract 1.)
- Total cleanup at Gui_WinLose, removed all references to global objects for quest and match-related entites. 
- Some of quest rewards calculations use now special functions in QuestData class.
- Tracking of win and lose conditions refactored (see Player and Upkeep classes.)
- Fixed typo.
- Bug: 144. Fixed compatibility with Java 7. Problem was due to inability to deserialize display_new_layout.xml. I changed that file's default serializer to XStream. This fix maintains compatibility with existing display_new_layout.xml when possible, and uses an XStream-generated display_layout.xml when it cannot parse the former. Note this updates the default display_layout.xml, which looks OK under Windows XP with resolution 1024x768.
- Issue 92: Reorganization of Costs.
- Fixed a few cards to adhere to new Cost requirements.
- Added questData.dat to svn:ignore on res/quest, so developers don't accidentally add it to the repository.
- Fixed NPE in IsPlayer().
- HumanPlayer wasn't saved apparently.
- Player can choose which booster to receive in the course of quest: containing only T2 cards, Extanded or Legacy (the way it was before).

- Added the recent commit logs to changes.txt.
- Quest reward cards are being presented in a much cleaner detailed view.
- Updated maven-jar-plugin.
- Aestetic text changes, booster type "T2" renamed to Standard.
- Fix: Player could not concede having Platinum Angel on battlefield.

If someone can do it with Iterator, go for it.
