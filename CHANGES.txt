Forge Beta: 1#-##-2012 ver 1.3.1

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

11### cards in total.


Added Return to Ravnica Guild Sealed Deck mode. Start a new sealed deck game, choose "Block / Set" and then scroll down until you find "Return to Ravnica Guild Sealed (block)". Select that. From the "Choose Set Combination" menu, select the first option. You will be prompted twice to pick your guild (once for the promo cards, once for the actual booster - you should choose the same guild both times). After that you're ready to go.

A bug for the new set unlocking code is now fixed. Before the fix, you could unlock all you wanted, but the unlocking info and the cards you got would never be saved! Fortunately, your paid money wouldn't be saved either.

The Return to Ravnica set pictures are now available and you can download them using the Download LQ Set Picures button. The RtR token generating cards have been updated with set specific images.

The Targeting Overlay has been fixed and re-enabled. It now correctly shows the targeting arcs in cases when it previously showed them in the wrong direction. The match UI is properly refreshed when the targeting arcs are switched on/off. The defunct "mouseover-only" mode is currently disabled (it crashes Forge, difficult to fix).

On several occasions people have noticed that the forge deck editor and/or quest mode card shop would not open or display. We have also received reports that some of the tabs/panels in the deck editor are missing. Try deleting the file named "editor_preferred.xml" which is found in the "res/layouts" folder. This should force forge to then use the "editor_default.xml" file instead.

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with eachother. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

It seems like the front face of double faced cards aren't triggering properly, but the back face and single faced cards are.

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there are two remaining issues that we hope will be addressed in the near future.

1. Leave play triggers don't work correct for clones.
2. Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

We are now using a different system for our snapshot and beta releases. Unfortunately, this new system builds a jar file which does not accurately display the SVN revision number.

Forge may not be fully java 7 compatible at this time. We recommend that people downgrade to java 6.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
