(Thanks to the MAGE team for permission to use their targeting arrows.)
(Thanks to http://www.freesound.org/browse/ for providing some sound files.)

12### cards in total.

This version of forge includes a few sound files for the new sound effect system. While we have several sounds assigned to a few of the available events there are a number of events that do not yet have a assigned sound file. This should be considered a work in progress and we could use some help in finding interesting sounds that we can add to forge.

The sound files need to be in wav or au format, wav appears to be more widespread but the code can handle either format. The sound files need to be copyright-free and they should be in the public domain.

You can either record your own sounds if you have the necessary equipment or you may be able to find an appropriate sound on a website such as http://www.freesound.org/browse/

You should note that sound files can be large and we would like to avoid this if possible. A good size to shoot for would be 50 K or less. There is a freeware sound editor that may have versions for all operating systems. This app is named Audacity.

We have a forge forum topic at the Collectible Card Games Headquarters web site that is devoted to finding sounds for this new sound system. Please visit this topic and contribute a sound or two. We can use your help and assistance. :)

On several occasions people have noticed that the forge deck editor and/or quest mode card shop would not open or display. We have also received reports that some of the tabs/panels in the deck editor are missing. Try deleting the file named "editor_preferred.xml" which is found in the "res/layouts" folder. This should force forge to then use the "editor_default.xml" file instead.

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

It seems like the front face of double faced cards aren't triggering properly, but the back face and single faced cards are.

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there are two remaining issues that we hope will be addressed in the near future.

1. Leave play triggers don't work correct for clones.
2. Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

We are now using a different system for our snapshot and beta releases. Unfortunately, this new system builds a jar file which does not accurately display the SVN revision number.

Forge is likely to be compatible with Java 7 at this time. Some people have used forge with Java 7 and have not reported any problems that are related to Java 7. If you would like to upgrade to Java 7 and have held off because of Forge then you may upgrade as we do not think that it will cause an incompatibility type of problem. We will continue to try to maintain compatibility with Java 6 for the foreseeable future.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.


Fixes/Features:

- sideboarding affects the next match correctly
- use bulk operations for card moving where ever possible to avoid stale GUI updates
- reverting unwanted changes from r19381 to core classes
- fix background coloring not being displayed in deck editor card detail rarity label
- add tooltip for rarity label
- Fixed broken Shandalar decks.
- add default editor preferences file so missing preferences will always have a default value
- remove editor.preferences from repo -- it will get created as necessary
- set better width and sorting defaults
- wrap card catalog toggle filters when the tab is resized small
- make current deck stats widgets wrappable
- Converted inlined classes to nested
- remove unused imports
- cosmetic changes in chooses (i'm thinking of a good way to make that choices player-independent)
- Moved check for card controller (used in CardDetailPanel and ImageCache) to card class - that's not perfect, but at least eliminates code duplication.
- calls to AI-related methods require the player parameter to have AIPlayer type to enable calls to ai-specific methods (like acquiring aicontroller by aiplayer.getcontroller().getai() and performing something from it) without need to cast types)
- replaced deprecated methods isHuman/isComputer with reference comparisons (to compare with acting player) and checks of player's hostility.
- predictThreatenedObjects moved from AbilityFactory to ComputerUtil (for now, will find a more specific place later)
- GameActionUtil.payCostDuringAbilityResolve method now demands player parameter (though it is always human player)
- fix NPE in card detail when the card does not belong to any set (e.g. a token)
- GameAction - extract method * 3
- GameActionUtil - uses common GuiDialog.confirm
- CardFactoryLands - converted inlined class to nested
- ChangeZoneEffect - removed stringbuilder wrapper (as it was not used anyway)
- replaced isComputer/isHuman where it was clear and possible
- Fixed a bug with AddToughness.
- Removed reminder text for suspend from Talon Gates. Description was too long for SA choice window so the second choice was hidden (on a 1280 wide display at least). We need to find a way to wrap text in the choice window when it would extend past the edge of the screen.
- Fix last commit commiting WIP.
- Another fix for AddToughness.
- Fixed Verdant Haven.
- Fixed Ogre Slumlord.
- Sell lands down to 50 when selling all extras in the card shop
- Converted Alpha Status to script
- remove cards from one table after adding them to the other table so the displayed card stays consistent with the focused card
- Made it possible to include special rewards like predefined cards or duplicate cards in Quest duels.
* Some notes:
*  Special rewards for normal duels should be extremely rare, mostly for very hard opponents, 1 special reward per opponent, and always a percentage chance of getting the special reward (preferably less than 50%) rather getting a guaranteed reward.
*  In the interests of downward compatibility, it is possible to define the Card Reward either in the [quest] portion (like before) or the [metadata] portion of the dck file. (Duels do not have the [quest] portion but if the definition were simply moved from [quest] to [metadata], all current challenge files would have stopped working properly.)
- Removed duplicate sharesCreatureTypeWith property from isValid
- Added the recent commit logs to changes.txt. Preparing for the snapshot build release.
