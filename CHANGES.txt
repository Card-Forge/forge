Forge Beta: ##-##-2011 ver 1.1.# rev #####

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set 

http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

#### cards in total.


Every expansion and set included in forge is now at least 70% complete.

The maximum size for a card displayed on the battlefield is now set using the New Game menu command "Specify Max CardSize". Added icons that will be drawn over the cards in the battlefield for phasing and counters. The attack/block/phasing icons and counters will now also be shown on large cards, only casting cost will be omitted. Lands and tokens with different amounts/types of counters will no longer stack. Tokens with different summoning sickness will no longer stack. Lands that become creatures will now always be moved to the front row.


We have changed the archiving format to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these archives.


The Mac OS application version:

We have packaged the Forge ##-##-2011 BETA version as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process.

You can move a copy of your pictures and decks over to the Forge.app application. Right click or control click on the Forge.app icon. Select Show Package Contents form the contextual menu. A Finder window will open and will display a folder named Contents. Navigate to the folder:

/Contents/Resources/Java/res/

Your decks can be placed in the decks folder, your pics can be placed in the pics folder, etc.
