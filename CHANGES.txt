Forge Beta: 0#-##-2012 ver 1.#.# rev 14###

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

10### cards in total.


We have a new skin by WompWomp named "Firebloom" included in this version.

The avatar-switch bug at runtime should now be fixed.

The quest mode plant wall's Deathtouch ability was deemed to be too strong against the AI's attack code and this ability was changed to Wither in this version. There are plans to make further adjustments to the pets as part of the upcoming forge 1.2.7 release.


The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove usefull. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

We have changed the archival format used for the Forge distributions from ".zip" to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
