(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

10### cards in total.

The work on the new UI is now finished. We should not expect major changes or major additions to the UI. Future betas may include a few minor bug fixes to the UI. And we may also include a few minor tweaks.

Selecting a package of cards in the quest mode card shop will not display the packages in the card picture and card detail panels.

Some people have noticed special quests do not have the start in play cards appearing. And some people have noticed that a match can start without any cards appearing in the players hands or in their libraries. We hope to have this problem fixed at some point in the future.

We are now using a different system for our snapshot and beta releases. Unfortunately, this new system builds a jar file which does not accurately display the SVN revision number.

Forge may not be fully java 7 compatible at this time. We recommend that people downgrade to java 6.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

We have changed the archival format used for the Forge distributions from ".zip" to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.


Fixes/Features:

- Cleared out the changes.txt file, now ready for new material.
- Remove the string "-r15897" from the title bar but not other SVN rev numbers.
- Fixed Martyr of Sands.
- Little AI tweak in AF Draw.
- Added the recent commit logs to changes.txt. Preparing for the snapshot build release.
- Fixed cost of Brain Pry.
- Added AI checks so it doesn't pump creatures that will die when targeted.
- Added SVar:Targeting:Dies to relevant creatures.
- Added SVar to Clone and Phantasmal Image so AI will not cast these spells when there are no creatures to copy.
- Added the recent commit logs to changes.txt. Preparing for the snapshot build release.
