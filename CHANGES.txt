Forge Beta: 01-16-2012 ver 1.2.1 rev 13212

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

9919 cards in total.


A new branch was created for supporting "Produced$ Any" in mana abilities (Issue 266). Some other bugs/problems with paying mana costs were uncovered and fixed. This work was recently merged into the main trunk.

A new Scriptable Replacement Effects system has been recently added to the SVN. The structure is very similar to Triggers (So there's currently a little code duplication), there is a Handler class, a base class for Replacement effects and subclasses for each event that can be replaced.


Several people have noticed a crash report stating that "Buffers have not been created". We hope to have this fixed in the near future. It has been pointed out that:

"Parts of Swing use EventQueue by themselves, this means your Swing code executes in main thread part executes in EDT and as Swing isn't thread safe this leads to elusive errors like this. One of the reasons of this error is that the frame might not be fully constructed before buffers are created -> race condition between the threads."

Several people have noticed forge slowing down after playing a number of matches without quitting forge in between the matches that are played. The new UI may be involved somehow. We also hope to have this figured out and fixed in the near future. Please be patient in the meanwhile. A recent fix was implemented that should improve the slowdown problem somewhat.

A lot of time and effort have gone into fixing the memory leak problems that were recently noticed and reported to the dev team. Doublestrike and Slapshot deserve our applause and we are very thankful. People should be able to now play long multi match sessions without noticing slow downs and pauses.


The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove usefull. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

We have changed the archival format used for the Forge distributions from ".zip" to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.
