Forge Beta: ##-##-2011 ver 1.#.# rev #####

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

#### cards in total.


A new UI is being developed and it will take some time before it is finished. Forge is somewhat unstable at this time as the new user interface is a work in progress.

The first step was to update the battlefield window. The second step was to update the New Game window and this section still needs a lot of work. We want to get constructed node and then quest modes working first  and will then try to get the draft and sealed modes working again afterwards.

Enjoy the new work and be patient as this part of the project moves forward. For now, only "Constructed" mode is far enough along to be considered reasonably stable. We hope to have quest mode working again in the near future.

The JuzamJedi cube has once again been updated with a newer list of cards.


The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove usefull. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

We have changed the archival format used for the Forge distributions from ".zip" to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.
