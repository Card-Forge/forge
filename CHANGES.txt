Forge Beta: 0#-##-2012 ver 1.2.10

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

10### cards in total.


We have added 98.29% of the cards from the new M13 set to forge. With new cards and reprints we now have 230 out of 234 M13 cards in forge.

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there are two remaining issues that we hope will be addressed in the near future.

1. Leave play triggers don't work correct for clones.
2. Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

The work on the new UI is now finished. We should not expect major changes or major additions to the UI. Future betas may include a few minor bug fixes to the UI. And we may also include a few minor tweaks.

Selecting a package of cards in the quest mode card shop will not display the packages in the card picture and card detail panels.

Some people have noticed special quests do not have the start in play cards appearing. And some people have noticed that a match can start without any cards appearing in the players hands or in their libraries. We hope to have this problem fixed at some point in the future.

We are now using a different system for our snapshot and beta releases. Unfortunately, this new system builds a jar file which does not accurately display the SVN revision number.

Forge may not be fully java 7 compatible at this time. We recommend that people downgrade to java 6.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

We have changed the archival format used for the Forge distributions from ".zip" to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
