Release Notes
-------------

- Java 7 -
The devs are discussing a plan to update the battlefield display code with Java FX 2.2 and this should help to improve a few things. Java FX 2.2 requires Java 7 so it is important for members of our user base to update in the near future as Forge at the time of the update will no longer run under Java 6.


- New M14 cards -
We have added a branch to our SVN for the new cards that are currently being scripted. These cards are not yet available in this build of forge. Please be patient and they will soon become available.


- Blank screen when starting a match -
This problem should be fixed. At least you'll see an exception/crash report describing why the match didn't start instead of a blank screen.


- Duplicate triggers problem solved -
This problem has now been fixed. (Mana Vortex required 2 lands, Emrakul gave 2 extra turns, Empty the Warrens creatures two Storm triggers instead of one.)


- Constructed mode AI vs AI matches -
Added support for AI vs AI matches. There is a checkbox which allows you to view the AI vs AI match. This is a work in progress and is not finished. While it appears to work OK there is still a need for a few UI changes. Please be patient. These AI vs AI matches will not be a good way to test out various deck types against one another as the AI does not understand card combos and the AI is still limited at this time.


- Constructed mode Human vs Human Hotseat matches -
Hotseat matches are now possible. This mode has some known bugs to fix. At this time both players must use the same computer. Human vs Human matches via the internet is planned and should become available sometime in the future. Please be patient.


- Using predetermined decks in quest mode Challenges -
Added the capability to play Challenges vs predetermined decks (along with a few other related options to disallow specific quest mode things). Added Sorin vs Tibalt, and Tibalt vs Sorin as examples of Challenges that force you to use a specific Deck. (They seemed to be the best duel deck compatibility for the AI).

Known Issues
------------

We have received several reports about a Null Pointer Exception crash report which contains the following info:

java.lang.NullPointerException
   at forge.gui.match.VMatchUI.populate(VMatchUI.java:###)
   at forge.control.FControl.changeState(FControl.java:###)

We currently suspect that this is a thread misuse issue. This will cause forge to crash eventually on some systems. Once the SwingWorkers that start different types of matches are refactored this problem should be fixed. The problem with a match starting with a blank screen will also be gone.

A small number of cards including Wall of Corpses, Abu Ja'far and others with a similar ability are not functional. The common issue here is actually that they check the blocker/attacker after being removed from the battlefield. Probably need to use LKI. Regular destroy/destroy all effects work just fine. The problem cards are caring about battlefield specific properties, that no longer apply when the base card is no longer on the battlefield.

On several occasions people have noticed that the Forge deck editor and/or quest mode card shop would not open or display. We have also received reports that some of the tabs/panels in the deck editor are missing. There has also been reports that Forge will crash while creating/populating display components during start up or crash when a match is started. One or both of your layout xml files may be corrupted in some fashion. Try deleting the file(s) named "editor.xml" and/or "match.xml" that are now located in your userDir/preferences/ directory. This should force Forge to then use the default layout xml files instead.

Several people have noticed that the cards displayed on the battlefield will fail to be displayed when the number of cards on the battlefield increases. Maximizing the human panel can help to re-display the cards.

Some time was spent turning the static ETB triggers into the proper ETB replacement effects they should be, mainly to interact correctly with each other. This work is not yet finished. As a result there is currently some inconsistencies with "Enters the battlefield with counters" (Not incredibly noticeable).

A recent contribution to the code base should fix some of the bugs that people noticed with cloning type abilities. At this time there are two remaining issues that we hope will be addressed in the near future.

1. Leave play triggers don't work correct for clones.
2. Copies of cards that setup Zone Change triggers via addComesIntoPlayCommand and addLeavesPlayCommand will not function correctly.

There is currently a known issue with some of the cards that have effects triggering after the card goes to graveyard (e.g. Wall of Corpses, Abu Ja'Far) not working correctly.

Forge is likely to be compatible with Java 7 at this time. Some people have used forge with Java 7 and have not reported any problems that are related to Java 7. If you would like to upgrade to Java 7 and have held off because of Forge then you may upgrade as we do not think that it will cause an incompatibility type of problem. We will continue to try to maintain compatibility with Java 6 for the foreseeable future.

The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove useful. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

The archive format used for the Forge distribution is ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to extract/decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you extract/decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
