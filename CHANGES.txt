Forge Beta: 0#-##-2012 ver 1.2.7 rev 1####

(Quest icons used created by Teekatas, from his Legendora set http://raindropmemory.deviantart.com)

10### cards in total.


Some adjustments to the pets in quest mode were made. This includes a new pet. :)

Some people have noticed recently that cost change was working for the human player but not the computer player. A fix was made and this should no longer be a problem.

The Battlefield UI has a new feature implemented which allows us to move and resize the panels to new places on the battlefield. This allows us to personalize the battlefield display to our own liking. You should try moving panels by clicking and dragging their tabs.

If you do not like your efforts to personalize the battlefield display you can revert the display to the default layout by clicking on the Dock button labeled "Revert layout".

A bug with the constructed mode has been discovered and has not yet been fixed. If you select "Fully random color deck" and activate the "Singleton Mode" checkbox Forge will freeze when you click on the Start button. This is now fixed and you can once again use singleton mode.


A couple of problems with the quest mode were noticed some time ago and they have been discussed on the developer section of the forge forum.

Some people have noticed special quests do not have the start in play cards appearing. And some people have noticed that a match can start without any cards appearing in the players hands or in their libraries.

We hope to have this problem fixed at some point in the future.

A bug with the transform and flip cards has been reported recently. This bug prevents you from casting these cards from your hand. It is currently being investigated, but has not been fixed yet.


The Forge archive includes a readme.txt file and we ask that you spend a few minutes reading this file as it contains some information that may prove usefull. We do tend to update this file at times and you should quickly read this file and look for new information for each and every new release. Thank you.

We have changed the archival format used for the Forge distributions from ".zip" to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these ".tar.bz2" archives. We recommend that you decompress the Forge archive into a new and unused folder.

Some people use the Windows application 7zip. This utility can be found at http://www.7-zip.org/download.html. Mac users can double click on the archive and the application Archive Utility will launch and extract the archive. Mac users do not need to download a separate utility.
