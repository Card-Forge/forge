Forge Beta: 0#-##-2011 ver 1.1.#

#### cards in total.


A new bug reporting system based on Mantis is being developed. When Forge crashes a new report form will appear that will allow you to send in a detailed bug report.

We would like to remove the old "Current Known Bugs" list topic on the forum. While this topic has been useful over the last two years it may be time to try another approach.

In the future bugs and other issues will be reported with the Bug Report form, the Mantis based Cardforge Issue Tracker or by posting a message on the then current forge beta release topic at CCGH.


We have changed the archiving format to ".tar.bz2". There are utilities for Windows, Mac OS and the various *nix's that can be used to decompress these archives.


The Mac OS application version:

We have packaged the Forge ##-##-2011 BETA version as a Mac OS application. You can double click the Forge.app icon to launch the forge application on your Apple computer running Mac OS. This application will automatically increase the java heap space memory for you as it launches. This version does not require the forge.command file and it does not need to start the Terminal application as part of the start up process.

You can move a copy of your pictures and decks over to the Forge.app application. Right click or control click on the Forge.app icon. Select Show Package Contents form the contextual menu. A Finder window will open and will display a folder named Contents. Navigate to the folder:

/Contents/Resources/Java/res/

Your decks can be placed in the decks folder, your pics can be placed in the pics folder, etc.

- Continue to slowly refactor forge.view.swing.Main. Moved some code from forge.view.swing.Main to forge.model.FModel. Improved Main's error handling to catch all Throwables. Turned FModel into a class that could later be turned into an interface. We're not changing models any time soon, so it made sense. Did not do the same for FView; I could see us potentially using a different view for future unit tests. Created nascent forge.view.swing.ApplicationView.
- Continue to slowly refactor forge.view.swing.Main. Minor changes to forge.view.swing.Main that should have gone into the last commit.
- Activate $Id$ processing for Git in .java, .properties, and top-level txt files. $Id$ should be replaced by the Git revision SHA-1 hex identifier at checkout, and reversed upon check-in.
- Maybe I used the wrong syntax for .gitattributes?
- Automatically fill in and lock the Git field if known. If $Id$ does get replaced properly, we fill in the Git field and set it non-editable. But sometimes $Id$ doesn't get substituted at all. In that case, we allow the user to edit the field.
- Fixed bug in detection of whether $Id$ had been replaced.
- Fixed Primal Whisperer.
- Revert $Id$ changes.
- Ignore $Id$.
- Fixed Maggot Therapy and Sigil Blessing.
- Reverted Sigil Blessing. The implementation is a hack, but there is no scriptable way around it for now.
- Fixed Stoic Ephemera.
- Fixed Gobhobbler Rats. The Hellbent flag does not work in StaticAbility. Actually, it does work, I just missed the lower-cased b.
- A real fix for Gobhobbler Rats.
