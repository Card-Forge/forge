Oracle:Flying; flanking (Whenever a creature without flanking blocks this creature, the blocking creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.)\nSuspend 3-{W} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {W} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
