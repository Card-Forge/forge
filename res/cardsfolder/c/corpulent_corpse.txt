Oracle:Fear (This creature can't be blocked except by artifact creatures and/or black creatures.)\nSuspend 5-{B} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {B} and exile it with five time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
