Oracle:When Adder-Staff Boggart enters the battlefield, clash with an opponent. If you win, put a +1/+1 counter on Adder-Staff Boggart. (Each clashing player reveals the top card of his or her library, then puts that card on the top or bottom. A player wins if his or her card had a higher converted mana cost.)
