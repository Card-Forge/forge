Oracle:Protection from black, flanking (Whenever a creature without flanking blocks this creature, the blocking creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.)\nSuspend 3-{1}{W}{W} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {1}{W}{W} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)\nWhen the last time counter is removed from Riftmarked Knight while it's exiled, put a 2/2 black Knight creature token with flanking, protection from white, and haste onto the battlefield.
