Oracle:Flying\nWhen Riftwing Cloudskate enters the battlefield, return target permanent to its owner's hand.\nSuspend 3-{1}{U} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {1}{U} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
