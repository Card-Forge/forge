Oracle:Return target permanent to its owner's hand. Exile Reality Strobe with three time counters on it.\nSuspend 3-{2}{U} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {2}{U} and exile it with three time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost.)
