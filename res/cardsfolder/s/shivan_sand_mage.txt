Oracle:When Shivan Sand-Mage enters the battlefield, choose one - Remove two time counters from target permanent or suspended card; or put two time counters on target permanent with a time counter on it or suspended card.\nSuspend 4-{R} (Rather than cast this card from your hand, you may pay {R} and exile it with four time counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a time counter. When the last is removed, cast it without paying its mana cost. It has haste.)
