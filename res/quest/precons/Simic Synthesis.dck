Name=Simic Synthesis
Description=The Simic Combine is always evolving—literally! The evolve mechanic means your creatures are constantly growing into new and unusual forms. A creature with evolve gets a +1/+1 counter if a larger creature (meaning it has a greater power or a greater toughness) enters the battlefield under your control. After enough evolutions, even the smallest creature can sit on top of the food chain.
