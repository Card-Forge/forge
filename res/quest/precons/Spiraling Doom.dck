Name=Spiraling Doom
Description=The "Spiraling Doom" deck is an extremely reactive deck: most of your decisions will depend on what your opponent is doing and how your opponent is trying to win the game. The key card in your deck is Birthing Pod, which lets you sacrifice a creature to go get a slightly more expensive creature out of your library.
