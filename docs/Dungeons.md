## Story Dungeons

Currently, the story is very much a work in progress and will change a lot in the future. The end goal will consist of multiple "tiers" of more difficult dungeons, where you will be guided by quests. Currently, only some of the story dungeons are available, and there are no quests to guide you to them. You can enter these dungeons and fight the bosses.

### Tier 1: Castles
The first tier of story bosses will consist of five dungeons, each found in the center of the five colored biomes. Each boss gives a plethora of loot (cards, life, shards, gold) and if you are able to defeat all five bosses, you can get a Mox card of your choice.

### Tier 2: Planeswalker Temples
Currently only the Temple of Chandra (red biome) and Temple of Liliana (black biome) are available. These tend to be harder than the castles mentioned above.
