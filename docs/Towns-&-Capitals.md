# Towns & Capitals

While exploring the world of Shandalar, you will find multiple cities across all biomes. These settlements are a integral part of the game, and can help the player by giving quests, hosting draft/jumpstart events, as well as selling cards and booster packs.

## Towns

![Red Town](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5596b9d5-8d21-4d8b-9ad8-aeeace22ed30)
![Green Town](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0482ae8a-2dae-4855-9c12-38c9b0f49269)

Different towns have different buildings, but some of them are common to them. Buildings are identified by the sign right in front of them.

- The Inn

    ![The Inn](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e2f8454-051a-404d-abcf-645b362e2db6)

    At the inn, players can buy temporary healthpoints, sell cards and join events. Different inns host different events. For example, a town can be hosting a draft for "Urza's Saga Block", while the next one can be hosting a Jumpstart 2025 event.

- Job Board
    
    ![Job Board](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d913eb70-75f2-424c-8307-5ee6207d92e5)

    Going to the job board the player can accept quests, which will reward them with gold and sometimes local reputation. Local reputation reduces the prices of cards sold by shops.

- Shard Trader

    ![Shard Trader](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19eb6bd0-a002-4ac0-906e-ad9663903f72)

    The shard trader allows player to trade gold for shards and shards for golds. Shards are used to reroll cards at the shop, as well as joining events.

- Card Shops

    ![Card Shop 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6459859-c745-4e58-a17d-bef689a57c2b)
    ![Card Shop 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e80eedeb-7b25-4d57-a285-10f44a18a47d)

    Card shops sells cards according to the biome and the shop itself. For example, shops in a green city will tend to sell green cards, while shops in a black city will focus on black cards.  
    Different shops sells different types of cards, and most of them can be deduced from their name. For example, the shop called "Control Magic" will sell blue cards used to control opponents (counter, tap, untap, etc), while a shop called "Swords, Plowshares, and Beyond" will sell cards that exile permanents. The shop information can be a found in [this user-friendly JSON](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge/blob/master/forge-gui/res/adventure/Shandalar/world/shops.json).  
  
    Shops with an Hour Glass sign change their stock daily. All other shops restock only using shards to reroll.

    The Smith is one of the most important buildings while trying to build a specific deck. Through a filtering system, players can try to create specific cards, by entering the set, mana value, colors and rarity of one or more cards. The more filters you use, the more expensive it gets.

There are other buildings for you to explore on your journey through Shandalar. Have fun!
