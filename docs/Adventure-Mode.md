# What is Adventure Mode?

Adventure mode is a work-in-progress game mode where you explore the ever-changing landscape of Shandalar, duel creatures to earn gold and new cards to  battle the various bosses. You can visit towns to buy equipment and cards, and crawl through dungeons to find artifacts and loot to help you on your journey. Adventure mode is an awesome reimagining of the original "Shandalar" 1997 PC Game in Forge, even though the scope of adventure is much broader and we don't constrain ourselves to the lore of the plane of Shandalar. You can play Shandalar on Desktop (Linux, Windows, IOS) or on Android devices.
