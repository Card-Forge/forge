<h2>Unstable</h2>
So you want to assemble a Contraption?

No problem! Follow these $`\xcancel{\sf{four}}`$ $`\hat{H}|\psi(t)\rangle = i\hbar\frac {\normalsize\,\,\,\circlearrowright\!\!\!\!\!\circlearrowleft\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\small\curlyeqsucc\normalsize\!\!\!\!\!\!\cdotp\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\small\ldotp\normalsize\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\cdotp\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\small\curlyeqprec} {\normalsize\,\,\,\circlearrowright\!\!\!\!\!\circlearrowleft\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\small\curlyeqsucc\normalsize\!\!\!\!\!\!\cdotp\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\small\ldotp\normalsize\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\cdotp\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\small\curlyeqprec\!\!t} |\psi(t)\rangle`$ easy steps and you'll be slapping together devious devices in no time!

1.  Contraptions start each game in a separate deck: the Contraption deck. <u>DON'T</u> mix your Contraptions up with the rest of your cards!

2.  The Contraption deck has three sprockets. Start the game with a CRANK! counter on Sprocket 3.

3.  How do you assemble a Contraption? Reveal the top card of your Contraption deck, then choose one of your sprockets. Your Contraption enters the battlefield under that sprocket.

4.  At the beginning of your upkeep, if you control a Contraption, move the CRANK! counter to your next sprocket and crank any number of Contraptions on that sprocket, putting their triggered abilities onto the stack. Remember the sprocket order: $`\Bbb{1}\to\Bbb{2}\to\Bbb{3}\to\Bbb{1}`$ ...

In Limited, you can play as many Contraptions as you have in your pool. How and when your Contraptions are assembled may yield wildly varying results from game to game. Experiment with different combinations and sequences and you're $`\xcancel{\sf{likely}}`$ CERTAIN to create something $`\xcancel{\sf{interesting}}`$ ⚡MONUMENTALLY POWERFUL!!!⚡
