[[_TOC_]]

_NOTE: These factories are refactored from time to time (often to adapt to new sets), so while some entries could be slightly outdated, the base information should still be correct._

AbilityFactory parses differently from the Keyword parser. Your Ability line will look more like this:

`A:{AB/SP/DB/ST}$ <AFSubclass> | {Necessary$ Parameters}| {Separated$ By} | {Pipes$ Here}`

In most cases, each AF subclass implements both the Spell and Ability.
Much of the code is shared, so creating the data object will look very similar.

  - AB is for Activated Abilities.
  - SP is for Spell.
  - DB is for Drawback and for many abilities that are subsidiary to
    other things, like replacements. They are only used to chain AFs
    together, and will never be the root AF.
  - ST is for Static, this gets used in case the API should resolve without using the stack (e.g. special actions)

### Common Parameters

#### Cost / UnlessCost

`Cost$ <AbilityCost>` is the appropriate way to set the Cost of the Ability. Currently for spells, any additional costs including the original Mana cost need to appear in the Cost parameter in the AbilityFactory. For each card that uses it, the order in which the cost is paid will always be the same.

Secondary abilities such as the DB executed by triggers or replacements don't need costs. (This is one reason to use DB over AB in these cases.)

Read more about it in [Costs](Costs)

#### Target / Defined

There are two different ways to Target. One or the other will need to be used for Spells/Abilities that target. If your effect does not target, but instead defines what will be affected by the Spell/Ability, use the Defined Parameter.

Read more about it in [Affected / Targets](Targeting)

#### Restriction

[Restriction](Restrictions) restricts when spells/abilities can be activated or resolved. Common examples are Putrid Leech's only activate this once per turn or different cards that can activate from Zones like the Hand or the Graveyard.

#### SpellDescription

SpellDescription is how the text of the ability will display on the card and in the option dialog for cards with multiple abilities.

The SpellDescription for secondary abilities (both AB and DB) is now displayed when (and if) the ability prompts for user input in the prompt pane so it is useful to put some nice text there.

#### StackDescription

*(Optional)* StackDescription is the description the ability will have on the stack. This is automatically generated by the effect, but may be overridden using this parameter. This is sometimes needed with complex effects, when the generated text can't handle some details. Properties of the spell can be accessed like this: {c:Targeted}. You can reuse the spell text by just putting `SpellDescription` or `None` to leave it empty.

#### AI instructions

IsCurse$ True - For effects that are normally treated positive e. g. Pump

`AITgts$ BetterThanEvalRating.130`

## Factories

In Alphabetical Order.

### Attach

Attach is being used directly only for Auras, primarily for Aura Spells, but also for Auras entering the battlefield by some effect.

`AB$ Attach | Cost$ R R | ValidTgts$ Creature | AILogic$ Pump`

Parameters:

  - Object (optional) - This is the Object that will be Attached
    (generally the Source Card for Auras)
  - AILogic - AI Logic tells the AI which base AI code it should use for
    Attaching
      - GainControl - Gains Control of the Attached Permanent (Control
        Magic)
      - Curse - A Generic Curse the AI has a handful of checks to see
        what the most appropriate Target is.
      - Pump - A Generic Pump. The AI has a handful of checks to see
        what the most appropriate Target is.
      - ChangeType - For Attachments that change types. Evil Presence is
        a good example. This logic should be expanded.
      - KeepTapped - For Attachments that keep a Permanent tapped. The
        AI will also check for a few things like Vigilance, and another
        KeepTapped Aura. Paralyzing Grasp is a good example.

Attach separates the actually granting of abilities from the attaching to permanents to streamline how things work.

### BecomeMonarch

### Bond

Soulbonding two creatures

### Branch
Sometimes, an ability might do certain things when a specific condition is true, and other things if not. This can be implemented by using `Branch`.
The branch evaluates the SVar specified by the property `BranchConditionSVar`, using the comparison defined with `BranchConditionSVarCompare` (such as `GTY`, `LT1`, etc). Depending on whether the condition evaluated to true or false, the subability defined by `TrueSubAbility` or `FalseSubAbility` is executed.

The example below is for "Composer of Spring", which allows either a "land" or a "land or creature" to be put on the battlefield, depending on the number of enchantments in play under your control.

```
SVar:TrigBranch:DB$ Branch | BranchConditionSVar$ X | BranchConditionSVarCompare$ GE6 | TrueSubAbility$ PutLandCreature | FalseSubAbility$ PutLand
SVar:PutLand:DB$ ChangeZone | Origin$ Hand | Destination$ Battlefield | Tapped$ True | ChangeType$ Land.YouOwn
SVar:PutLandCreature:DB$ ChangeZone | Origin$ Hand | Destination$ Battlefield | Tapped$ True | ChangeType$ Creature.YouOwn,Land.YouOwn
SVar:X:Count$Valid Enchantment.YouCtrl
```


### ChangeState

Changing a cards State. This is mostly for Flip Cards or the Transform mechanic.

### ChangeZone

ChangeZone is a united front of any card that changes zone. This does
not include: drawing, discarding, destroying, or milling, as these
represent specific words on which triggers and replacements can react.
There are two primary forms, but the distinction is handled mostly in
the codebase. The only thing that is required is to set appropriate parameters.

Origin and Destination are both required.

Origin is where the card is coming from.

Destination is where the card is going to. If Destination is Library, a
LibraryPosition is recommended, but not required. **Default value of the
LibraryPosition is 0.** 0 represents the top of the library, -1 represents the bottom.

There are two primary versions of ChangeZone.

#### Hidden Origin

The first is hidden, generally used for Origin zones that are not known
information, like the Library or the Hand. The choice of "What card is
changing zones?" happens during resolution.

`A:SP$ ChangeZone | Cost$ W | Origin$ Library | Destination$ Library | LibraryPosition$ 0 | ChangeType$ Artifact,Enchantment | ChangeNum$ 1 | SpellDescription$ Search your library for an artifact or enchantment card and reveal that card. Shuffle your library, then put the card on top of it.`  
`A:AB$ ChangeZone | Cost$ T | Origin$ Hand | Destination$ Battlefield | ChangeType$ Land | ChangeNum$ 1 | Optional$ True | SpellDescription$ You may put a land card from your hand onto the battlefield.`

For Hidden, things like ChangeType and ChangeNum are used to restrict
what can ChangeZone, and how many do. There are two parameters special
to Hidden Origin:

"Chooser" defines which player has to decide which card changes zone
(example You, Opponent).

"Mandatory" most of these abilities are not mandatory, but some are.

#### Known Origin

The second is known, generally used for Origin zones that are known
information, like the Battlefield or the Graveyard. The choice of "What
card is changing zones?" happens on activation, generally by targeting.

`A:AB$ ChangeZone | Cost$ 1 U T | TgtPrompt$ Choose target artifact card in your graveyard | ValidTgts$ Artifact.YouCtrl | Origin$ Graveyard | Destination$ Library | SpellDescription$ Put target artifact card from your graveyard on top of your library.`  
`A:SP$ ChangeZone | Cost$ U U | ValidTgts$ Permanent | TgtPrompt$ Select target permanent | Origin$ Battlefield | Destination$ Hand | SpellDescription$ Return target permanent to its owner's hand.`

For Known, since it just uses Target, normal target parameters are used in this Scenario.

#### ChangeZoneResolve

This is a helper AF, for chained effects that create multiple permanents which should enter the battlefield at the same time.

To use it, you need to set the param "ChangeZoneTable" on the first effect and then call this at the end.

This is supported by the following effects:
 - Amass
 - CopyPermanent
 - RepeatEach (_NOTE: if you wrap the creation, you don't need to call this AF on its own_)
 - Token

### Charm

This allows cards that have a mode to be chosen to occur after a trigger.

Parameters

  - CharmNum - Number of Modes to Choose
  - Choices - A Comma delimited list of SVars containing the Modes

### Choose

#### ChooseType

This can be used when you are asked to choose a card type or creature type.

  - Type - Required - Can be Card or Creature
  - InvalidTypes - Optional - Use to specify any type that cannot be chosen (ex: "Choose any creature type except Wall")

The Defined is for target players.

*NOTE_: Make sure that when this is used with a SubAbility that the DB$AF\_Whatever will support Card.ChosenType. This will need testing on a case by case basis.*

### Clash

This AF handles clashing. It takes two special parameters: WinSubAbility and
OtherwiseSubAbility. They are both optional and work the same way,
namely that it contains the name of an SVar that in turn contains a
drawback to be executed. The example below is for Release the Ants.

`A:SP$ DealDamage | Cost$ 1 R | Tgt$ TgtCP | NumDmg$ 1 | SubAbility$ DBClash | SpellDescription$ Release the Ants deals 1 damage to target creature or player. Clash with an opponent. If you win, return CARDNAME to its owner's hand.`  
`SVar:DBClash:DB$ Clash | WinSubAbility$ DBReturn`  
`SVar:DBReturn:DB$ ChangeZone | Defined$ Self | Origin$ Stack | Destination$ Hand`

### Cleanup

A non-functional, maintenance AF used for Cleaning up certain Variables before a Spell finishes Resolving.

Parameters

  - ClearRemembered$ (optional) Set to True to clear this card's
    remembered list. Generally useful for Cards that Remember a card, do

NumDmg is required. This is the amount of damage dealt.

#### DamageAll

These APIs handles destruction of cards on the battlefield.

See [Sacrifice](Forge_AbilityFactory "wikilink") for special case:
'Target opponent chooses \[x cards\]. Destroy those \[cards\]'

#### DestroyAll

`A:SP$ DestroyAll | Cost$ 3 U | ValidCards$ Forest | SpellDescription$ Destroy all Forests.`

### Effect

Effect is an oddball of the AF family. Where usually AFs have similarities to each other to help with AI use, Effect doesn't fall under that jurisdiction. In general, an effect is some type of SA that
lasts longer than its resolution.

A good example is High Tide. For the rest of the turn, High Tide makes
all Islands produce an extra mana. It doesn't matter if the Island was
in play, if it turned into an Island after High Tide was cast, any of that.

`A:SP$ Effect | Cost$ U | Name$ High Tide Effect | Triggers$ IslandTrigger | SVars$ TrigMana | SpellDescription$ Until end of turn, whenever a player taps an Island for mana, that player adds U to his or her mana pool (in addition to the mana the land produces).`  
`SVar:IslandTrigger:Mode$ TapsForMana | ValidCard$ Island | Execute$ TrigMana | TriggerDescription$ Whenever a player taps an Island for mana, that player adds U to his or her mana pool (in addition to the mana the land produces).`  
`SVar:TrigMana:AB$Mana | Cost$ 0 | Produced$ U | Amount$ 1`

Effect is most similar to Token as it creates a pseudo-permanent, except
Effect creates in the command zone rather than the battlefield. It stays
active there for a set Duration.

Parameters

  - Abilities,Triggers,SVars are comma separated lists which contain
    SVars that point to the appropriate type that the Effect will gain.
  - Duration is how long the Effect lasts. Right now, most effects will
    last Until End of Turn. In the future, they may have other
    conditions.

Duration$ Permanent for effects that have no specific Duration.

  - Stackable$ False - Most Effects are assumed to be Stackable. By
    setting the Stackable Flag to False, the AI will know having a
    second one in play is useless, so will save it's Resource for
    something else.
  - Image - a file\_name\_without\_extension (image needs to reside in
    the tokens directory)

### Game outcome

#### Dig

Dig is for an ability that does basically this: "You look at the X cards
of your Library, put Y of them somewhere, then put the rest somewhere."
Think of Impulse.

  - DigNum - Required - look at the top number of cards of your library.
  - Reveal - Optional - for abilities that say "Reveal the top X cards
    of your library". Default is false.
  - SourceZone - Optional - the zone to dig in. Default is Library.
  - DestinationZone - Optional - the zone to put the Y cards in. Default
    is Hand.
  - LibraryPosition - Optional - if DestinationZone is Library, use this
    to specify position. Default is -1 (bottom of library).
  - ChangeNum - Optional - the number of cards to move to the
    DestinationZone (or "All" when it's for things like "put all lands
    revealed this way into your hand"). Default is 1.
  - ChangeValid - Optional - use this to specify if "you may move an
    artifact to DestinationZone". Default is any Card.
  - AnyNumber - Optional - use if you can move any number of Cards to
    DestinationZone. Default is false. (think of Lead the Stampede)
  - Optional - Optional - set this if you "may" move a card to
    DestinationZone. Default is false.
  - DestinationZone2 - Optional - the zone to put the rest of the cards
    in. If it is library, you are prompted for the order. Default is
    Library.
  - LibraryPosition2 - Optional - if DestinationZone2 is Library, use
    this to specify position. Default is -1 (bottom of library).

#### DigUntil

#### RevealHand

Look at a player's hand.

Target or Defined is required.

`A:AB$ RevealHand | Cost$ T | ValidTgts$ Player | TgtPrompt$ Select target player | SpellDescription$ Look at target player's hand.`

#### Scry

`A:AB$ Scry | Cost$ 1 T | ScryNum$ 2`

#### RearrangeTopOfLibrary

#### Reveal

`A:AB$ Reveal | Cost$ 2 U T | Defined$ You | RevealValid$ Card.Blue | AnyNumber$ True | RememberRevealed$ True`

Parameters:

  - RevealValid: to limit the valid cards.
  - AnyNumber
  - Random
  - RememberRevealed: to remember the cards revealed

#### PeekAndReveal

This AF is very similar to things that Dig can do, but handle a much
simpler form, with less complex coding underneath. Similar to how
RearrangeTopOfLibrary could be handled with Dig.

Primarily used with cards that allow you to Peek at the top card of your
library, and allow you to reveal it if it's of a certain type. The
Kinship cards fit this bill perfectly, so they are used to simplify the
complex popups that would be required if using multiple Dig
SubAbilities.

RevealOptional - Whether or not the Reveal is optional.

RememberRevealed - Whether to remember the revealed cards (after
filtering by Valid)

RememberPeeked - Whether to remember the peeked cards (only if they are
not revealed\!)

RevealValid - defaults to Card, but allows you to set a specific
ValidType if you can only have certain things

PeekAmount - defaults to 1, but allows you to peek at multiple cards if
possible

### RollDice

### Sacrifice

#### Sacrifice

Usually you choose a player and that player has to sacrifice something

`A:SP$ Sacrifice | Cost$ 1 B | ValidTgts$ Player | SacValid$ Creature | SacMessage$ Creature | Amount$ 2 | SpellDescription$ Target player sacrifices a creature.`

Destroy$ True - An optional parameter for destroying permanents target
player chooses (eg: Burning of Xinye, or Imperial Edict).

`A:SP$ Sacrifice | Cost$ 1 B | ValidTgts$ Opponent | SacValid$ Creature | SacMessage$ Creature | Destroy$ True | SpellDescription$ Target opponent chooses a creature he or she controls. Destroy it.`

#### SacrificeAll

### StoreSVar

### Token

Token simply lets you create tokens of any type.

`A:SP$ Token | Cost$ 3 W U | TokenImage$ W 1 1 Bird Flying | TokenAmount$ X | TokenName$ Bird | TokenTypes$ Creature,Bird | TokenOwner$ You | TokenColors$ Blue | TokenPower$ 1 | TokenToughness$ 1 | TokenKeywords$ Flying`

This ability factory does not take a target. All the parameters are
mandatory except for TokenKeywords. If you provide a non-integer for
TokenAmount, TokenPower or TokenToughness the AF will attempt to look for
an SVar of that name and interpret it's contents as a Count$ line. Worth
noting is that TokenTypes and TokenColors are simple commaseparated
lists while TokenKeywords is a list where the items are separated by
"\<\>". If TokenImage is not provided, the factory will attempt to
construct a filename on it's own. TokenOwner can use Defined-like
parameters, such as "You" "Opponent" or the new Triggered-Variables.

You can also use the parameters TokenAbilities$, TokenTriggers$ and
TokenSVars$ to give the created tokens any number of either. For
example, here's how Growth Spasm creates an Eldrazi Spawn token complete
with ability.

    SVar:DBToken:DB$Token | TokenAmount$ 1 | TokenName$ Eldrazi Spawn | TokenTypes$ Creature,Eldrazi,Spawn | TokenOwner$ You | TokenColors$ Colorless | TokenPower$ 0 | TokenToughness$ 1 | TokenAbilities$ ABMana SVar:ABMana:AB$Mana | Cost$ Sac<1/CARDNAME> | Produced$ 1 | Amount$ 1 | SpellDescription$ Add 1 to your mana pool. 

As another example, here's Mitotic Slimes' use of TokenTriggers$:

    T:Mode$ ChangesZone | Origin$ Battlefield | Destination$ Graveyard | ValidCard$ Card.Self | Execute$ TrigTokenSenior | TriggerDescription$ When CARDNAME is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, put two 2/2 green Ooze creature tokens onto the battlefield. They have "When this creature is put into a graveyard, put two 1/1 green Ooze creature tokens onto the battlefield." 
    SVar:TrigTokenSenior:AB$ Token | Cost$ 0 | TokenImage$ g 2 2 ooze | TokenName$ Ooze | TokenTypes$ Creature,Ooze | TokenColors$ Green | TokenOwner$ You | TokenPower$ 2 | TokenToughness$ 2 | TokenAmount$ 2 | TokenTriggers$ TriggerJunior | TokenSVars$ TrigTokenJunior 
    SVar:TriggerJunior:Mode$ ChangesZone | Origin$ Battlefield | Destination$ Graveyard | ValidCard$ Card.Self | Execute$ TrigTokenJunior | TriggerDescription$ When this creature is put into a graveyard, put two 1/1 green Ooze creature tokens onto the battlefield. SVar:TrigTokenJunior:AB$Token | Cost$ 0 | TokenImage$ g 1 1 ooze | TokenName$ Ooze | TokenTypes$ Creature,Ooze | TokenColors$ Green | TokenOwner$ You | TokenPower$ 1 | TokenToughness$ 1 | TokenAmount$ 2
