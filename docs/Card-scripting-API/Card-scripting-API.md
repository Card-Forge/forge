A reference guide for Scripting Cards using the API parsed by the Forge
Engine.

### Base Structure

By opening any file in the /res/cardsfolder folder you can see the basic
structure of how the data is created. Here's an example of a vanilla
creature:

```
Name:Vanilla Creature
ManaCost:2 G
Types:Creature Beast
Text:no text
PT:2/2
```

The name of this card is Vanilla Creature. It's casting cost is 2G. It
has the types Creature and Beast. It will not display any additional
text in the card's template. It has a Power-Toughness of 2/2. The text
line appears only if any rules printed on card are not backed by
abilities defined for the given card (in most cases presence of Text
line means such abilities are hardcoded).

If a card has two faces, use AlternateMode:{CardStateName} in the front face and separate both by a new line with the text "ALTERNATE".

There are a few other Parameters that will appear in most, if not all, cards. These are

| Property | Description
| - | -
|`A`|[Ability effect](AbilityFactory)
|`AI`|RemoveDeck:<br />* `All`<br />This will prevent the card from appearing in random AI decks. It is applicable for cards the AI can't use at all like Dark Ritual and also for cards that the AI could use, but only ineffectively like Tortoise Formation. The AI won't draft these cards.<br />* `Random`<br /> This will prevent the card from appearing in random decks. It is only applicable for cards that are too narrow for random decks like Root Cage or Into the North. The AI won't draft these cards.<br />* `NonCommander`<br /> 
|`Colors`|Color(s) of the card<br /><br />When a card's color is determined by a color indicator rather than shards in a mana cost, this property must be defined. If no identifier is needed, this property should be omitted.<br /><br />* `Colors:red` - This is used on Kobolds of Kher Keep, which has a casting cost of {0} and requires a red indicator to make it red.<br /><br />* `Colors:red,green` - Since Arlinn, Embraced by the Moon has no casting cost (it's the back of a double-faced card), the red and green indicator must be included.
|`DeckHints`|AI-related hints for a deck including this card<br /><br />To improve synergy this will increase the rank of of all other cards that share some of its DeckHints types. This helps with smoothing the selection so cards without these Entries won't be at an unfair disadvantage.<br /><br />The relevant code can be found in the [CardRanker](https://git.cardforge.org/core-developers/forge/-/blob/master/forge-gui/src/main/java/forge/gamemodes/limited/CardRanker.java) class.
|`DeckNeeds`|This can be considered a stronger variant when the AI should not put this card into its deck unless it has whatever other type is specified. The way this works is "inverted": it will directly decrease the rank of the card unless other cards are able to satisfy its types.<br />If a card demands more than one kind of type you can reuse it:<br />`DeckNeeds:Type$Human & Type$Warrior` will only find Human Warrior compared to `DeckNeeds:Type$Human\|Warrior` which is either
|`DeckHas`|specifies that the deck now has a certain ability (like, token generation or counters) so that the drafting/deckbuilding AI knows that it now meets requirements for DeckHints/DeckNeeds. This is actually very useful since many of these (such as Ability$Graveyard, Ability$Token, Ability$Counters) are not deduced by parsing the abilities, so an explicit hint is necessary. Using the other types is also supported in case the implicit parsing wouldn't find it.<br />It doesn't require exact matching to have an effect but cards that care about multiple entries for a given type will be judged higher if a card seems to provide even "more" synergy for it.<br />Example:<br />Chishiro has two abilities so `DeckHas:Ability$Token & Ability$Counters` is used, therefore score for `DeckNeeds:Ability$Token\|Counters` is increased
|`K`|Keyword
|`Loyalty`|Number of starting loyalty counters
|`ManaCost`|Cost to cast the card shown in mana shards<br /><br />This property is required. It has a single parameter that is a mana cost.<br /><br />* `ManaCost:no cost` for cards that cannot be cast<br />* `ManaCost:1 W W` sets the casting cost to {1}{W}{W}
|`Name`|Name of the card<br /><br />A string of text that serves as the name of the card. Note that the registered trademark symbol cannot be included, and this property must have at least one character.<br /><br />Example:<br />* `Name:A Display of My Dark Power` sets the card's name to "A Display of My Dark Power"
|`Oracle`|The current Oracle text used by the card.<br /><br />We actually have a Python Script that runs to be able to fill in this information, so don't worry about manually editing a lot of cards when Wizards decides to change the rules. <br /><br />This field is used by the Deck Editor to allow non-Legendary Creatures to be marked as potential commanders. Make sure "CARDNAME can be your commander." appears in the oracle text.
|`PT`|Power and toughness
|`R`|[Replacement effect](Replacements)
|`S`|[Static ability](static-abilities)
|`SVar`|String variable. Used throughout scripting in a handful of different ways.
|`T`|[Triggered ability](Triggers)
|`Text`|Additional text that needs to be displayed on the CardDetailPanel that doesn't have any spell/ability that generates a description for it, for example "CARDNAME can be your commander." or "X can't be 0.".
|`Types`|Card types and subtypes<br /><br />Include all card types and subtypes, separated by spaces.<br /><br />Example:<br />* `Types:Enchantment Artifact Creature Golem` for a card that reads Enchantment Artifact Creature -- Golem

Rarity and Set info are now defined in edition definition files. These can be found at /res/reditions path.

## General SVars

`SVar:SoundEffect:goblinpolkaband.mp3`

The sound system supports a special SVar that defines the sound that should be played when the spell is cast.

`SVar:AltCost:[cost]`

This SVar is for cards that have an Alternate cost, such as Force of
Will. You are allowed to pay the Alternate Cost instead of the normal
Mana cost when casting this spell.

`SVar:AIPreference:SacCost$Creature.token,Creature.cmcLE2`

`SVar:AntiBuffedBy:[ValidCards]`

If a permanent with this SVar is on the battlefield under human control
the AI will play the specified cards in Main1. Applicable for cards like
Heart Sliver or Timid Drake.

`SVar:BuffedBy:[ValidCards]`

If a permanent with this SVar is on the battlefield under its control
the AI will play the specified cards in Main1. Applicable for creatures
with a P/T setting static ability (Kithkin Rabble) or additional buffes
(Radiant, Archangel).

`SVar:EnchantMe:[Multiple]/[Once]`

Creatures with "Multiple" in this SVar will always be prefered when the
AI enchants (Rabid Wombat), creatures with "Once" only if they are not
enchanted already (Gate Hound).

`SVar:EquipMe:[Multiple]/[Once]`

Creatures with "Multiple" in this SVar will always be prefered when the
AI equippes (Myr Adapter), creatures with "Once" only if they are not
equipped already (Kor Duelist).

`SVar:AIEvaluationModifier:[ValidAmount]`

`SVar:EndOfTurnLeavePlay:True`

`SVar:maxLevel:`

`SVar:HasCombatEffect:True`

`SVar:HasAttackEffect:True`

`SVar:HasBlockEffect:True`

`SVar:MustAttack:True`

`SVar:MustBeBlocked:True`

`SVar:NeedsToPlayVar:[ValidCards]`

`SVar:ManaNeededToAvoidNegativeEffect:`

`SVar:NonStackingEffect:True`

`SVar:PlayMain1:TRUE/ALWAYS/OPPONENTCREATURES`

The AI will play cards with this SVar in its first main phase. Without other AILogic, it will usually not play any permanents without this in Main1.

`SVar:SacMe:[number]`

The AI will sacrifice these cards to pay costs. The higher the number the higher the priority. Example: Hatching Plans has SVar:SacMe:5.

`SVar:Targeting:Dies`

`SVar:UntapMe:True`

The AI will prioritize untapping of this card.

`SVar:AIUntapPreference:`

`SVar:X:Count$`

Count is our general value computation function. It's quite varied with a lot of different things it can calculate and is often being updated.
