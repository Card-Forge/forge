Forge provides an in-game console in adventure mode.

You can access (and close) the console while exploring by pressing F9 (or Fn-F9).
The equivalent method to access the console on mobile is to hold down the character image in the right top of the screen.
Holding the character image again will close the console (as will typing `exit`).

To scroll the console window, click and drag the text box.
