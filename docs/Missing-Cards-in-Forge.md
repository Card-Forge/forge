## Missing tournament legal cards

Total number of unique cards in Forge (as of the release of Final Fantasy): 30,331
**For the latest updates during spoiler season** check out the "Projects" tab on Github for information which cards have been added. It takes some time to implement cards, and WotC doesn't send us spoilers ahead of time, so we barely have any time to implement new cards. Please be patient, and don't ask when cards will be ready.

## Missing variant cards

### [Bounty](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Outlaws_of_Thunder_Junction/Commander_decks#Bounty_cards) (Casual Variant)
The release of the Outlaws of Thunder Junction Commander Decks included a set of twelve "Bounty" cards and rules for a variant format that uses them. This format is not defined in the comprehensive rules, and is not currently implemented in Forge. 

### [Hero's Path](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Hero's_Path) (Promotional Variant)
During the Theros Block, a series of promotional events was held. These featured three PvE encounters with unique rules, along with nontraditional cards for use by both the player and enemies in these encounters. The PvE encounters could be reconstructed in Forge, but supporting the Heroes and Godslayer weapons would add many complications.


## Missing nonlegal and funny cards

Complete support for Un-cards and other non-legal cards is a non-goal of Forge, but individual cards may be implemented when they work within the scope of the project. For a complete list, see [Un-cards, Playtest Cards, and Other Funny Cards](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge/wiki/Un%E2%80%90cards,-Playtest-Cards,-and-Other-Funny-Cards).
