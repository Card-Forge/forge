# Mana Shards
Mana Shards are a custom resource created for Adventure Mode in Forge. Shards serve as a secondary form of currency in some parts of the game economy, can be bought and sold via dedicated Shard Trader merchants, and are also used to power the player's special abilities both on the Adventure world map as well as in almost all Adventure Mode duels. During a duel your Shards will appear as a usable resource visible alongside your life total akin to how Energy tokens are used. Your Shards are not tokens or counters, and are thus immune to any abilities that would affect tokens or counters outside of using [equipment](adventure-items) that specifically requires their expenditure. Spending your shards is a permanent choice, however, as your final total at the end of the match will follow you back into your Adventure.

As Mana Shards are not self-replenishing, using them for activated abilities that affect the game world and in-match gameplay is a way of letting the player have a constant challenge of their own comfort level. If the player is comfortable taking on a fight without using extra abilities afforded to them by use of Shards, they will have more of them available to spend on in town, or can simply save their full might for boss-level entities. 

The most consistent source of Mana Shards is from match wins, players receive one Shard per win without any rewards having to be explicitly added to the encounter. However, when used to power equipment and abilities, one Shard per match will definitely not break even, as most custom Adventure cards and items will cost 2-4 per use. However, Mana Shards can also be purchased in towns, picked up in dungeons, and can be received in large quantities from completing [Quests](Adventure-Quests).

Mana Shards can be used for:
* Activated in-match abilities
* Activated game map abilities
* Refreshing card shop inventories
* Spellsmith card purchases as an alternative to gold
* Event entry fees as an alternative to gold
