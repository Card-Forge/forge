Non-legal "funny" cards are considered low priority for implementation in Forge. Many of them require an immense amount of work to support mechanics that only appear on one or two cards. Others are impossible to add without expanding the scope of Forge beyond that of a rules simulator. That said, Forge does support some of these cards, and new ones are implemented on a "whenever someone gets around to doing it" basis.

Below is a list of all "Funny" cards, organized by estimated viability of implementing them in Forge, and roughly grouped by mechanic.

#### Disclaimer:

This is not intended as a to-do list, as an indication of how soon these cards will be implemented, as an indication of whether they will *ever* be implemented, as a thorough assessment of implementation difficulty, as a comprehensive list of complications that may emerge when attempting to implement these cards, nor as indicative of the maintenance costs associated with adding such edge cases to the project's code-base.

Comparisons between mechanics needed to support these cards and existing mechanics are not indicative of simplicity. Cards within tiers are loosely grouped by mechanic as a reference, so that implementations designed for one might be made flexible enough to account for others. 

The tiers below are not indicative of the amount of overall work needed to implement the cards or features within. They are a broader assessment of how the mechanics and spirit of the card are suited to Forge, to a rules engine, and to a digital environment altogether. 

Potential alterations to keep the spirit of the card are considered, and the position of the card may be adjusted accordingly. For example, Infernal Spawn of Evil has the player say "It's coming!" as a flavorful addition to a cost, and is placed in tier 2 because the card mostly maintains its spirit without the spoken dialog. Toy Boat has the player repeatedly say the words "Toy Boat" quickly as a tongue twister, and is placed down in Tier 6 because removing spoken dialog defeats the purpose of the card.

This page is subject to updates as challenges to implementing these cards are discovered or resolved.

Cards prefixed with (P) are playtest cards. Cards prefixed with (Uk) were exclusive to Unknown Events. Cards prefixed with (HTR) are from the Heroes of the Realm series.

1. (P) (Uk) Anax and Cymede & Kynaios and Tiro
1. Cardboard Carapace - Counts copies in the sideboard. Not exactly as written but very little room for improvement. Adventure+Quest Inventories?
1. Shoe Tree - Can't use actual shoes for counters sadly.
1. "Ach! Hans, Run!" - Just have to name the card.
1. Booster Tutor - Might want to expand to letting the player choose the pack instead of a random one, for consistency with Lore Seeker.
1. Urza, Academy Headmaster - Just chooses a random effect from his list, no internet connection required.
1. B.O.B. (Bevy of Beebles) - Link between loyalty counters and beebles is implemented as a state based action and static trigger. Probably fine? May need an exception to implement Rules Lawyer.
1. (P) Slivdrazi Monstrosity - Granting devoid made to work by actually removing their colors.
1. (Uk) Phila, Unsealed - Oracle replaced with the winning team's text rather than an always-on characteristic defining ability. Probably makes more sense this way.
1. (Uk) Disguise Agent - Loses some of its flare when commanders are public knowledge. See "Face Down Commanders", Tier 3.
1. (Uk) The Keeper of Dark Pacts - Done via Intesify. Unclear if this should affect other copies of the same card.
1. (Uk) The Rebellious Intelligence - Random card in sideboard. May need special attention if we ever rework Wish.
1. (Uk) Sojourner's Enforcermite - Affinitycycling's reminder text comes out a bit weird, but the function is there.

### Tier 0.5: Done*

1. Blacker Lotus - Only removes from match. Should delete from deck and/or collection in limited and adventure-like modes.
1. Ass Whuppin - Implemented as "Destroy target silver bordered permanent," leaving off the Acorn errata and the ability to target other games.
1. Spatula of the Ages - Implemented to look for silver border, but has since been errata'd to include acorn cards. (See also: "Un-Cards", Tier 2.)
1. Border Guardian - Borders are only tracked on an edition level. Silver-bordered SLD cards and borderless prints won't behave correctly. (See also: "Border Color Matters", Tier 3)
1. (P) Planequake - "Uncovered Cavern" plot booster still doesn't exist.
1. Sword of Dungeons & Dragons - Dragon token is colorless, not gold. See "NonWUBRG Colors" in Tier 5.
1. (HTR) Mountain Mover - Cards stored "Underneath" Mountain Mover are put into exile instead.
1. 1996 World Champion - Activated ability in library is implemented as an emblem created at the start of the game.
1. (HTR) War of the Spark - "from War of the Spark" is currently implemented with City in a Bottle logic, which reportedly could use some revision. Unclear if card is meant to look at exact printing or original printing. (See also: "Set Matters", Tier 2)
1. (Uk) The Battle of Dragon Brothers // Fate Reforged - Notes choices by card name similar to a draft choice.


#### Banned and Restricted as an effect
(These cards "ban" themselves or other cards via their text, but won't register alongside format bans. Can matter for wish effects.)
1. Once More With Feeling
1. Look at Me, I'm the DCI

1. Wild Crocodile
1. Angelic Rocket
1. Gnome-Made Engine
1. Labro Bot
1. Voracious Vacuum

#### Keyword or Mechanic Recreated via Card Script
(These cards have unique un-keywords or mechanics which haven't been implemented within the engine, but have been scripted such that they should work the same way for the most part. Edge case interactions may exist however, and a "keyword-matters" un-effect wouldn't be able to include them.)
1. Earl of Squirrel - Squirrellink; Uses a static trigger instead.
1. Nearby Planet - Rangeling; Uses a continuous "is all basic land types and all non-basic land types" ability.
1. Rainbow Dash - Player Coolness; Creates "Coolness Badge" effects to represent every 20% of coolness.
1. (Uk) Phyrexian Esthetician - Oil Scavenge
1. (Uk) Hound of Urabrask - "Oildying" (Undying but oil counters.)
1. (Uk) Incubob - "Incubate Dark Confidant 1"

1. (P) Gunk Slug - Similar to Time Sidewalk and Bone Rattler?
1. (P) Problematic Volcano - Similar to Raging River?
1. (P) Patient Turtle - Player went first this game. Seen with Forsaken Crossroad.
1. (P) Alberix, the Trade Planet - Resources seem mostly equivalent to "card exiled by CARDNAME", barring linked ability issues.
1. (P) Bolshack Dragon - Dunno if strikethrough in oracle text would be formatted, but is functionally all possible.
1. (P) Lich's Duel Mastery - Like Alberix, Shields seem like another "card exiled by CARDNAME".
1. (P) Luxior, Ignited - Nothing in the rules says a Planeswalker can't be attached to a creature...
1. (Uk) Untap, Upkeep, Draw - Similar to Obeka, Splitter of Seconds.
1. (Uk) Compleated Clone Shell - Think there should be some way to look at 4 random cards in the sideboard?
1. (Uk) Azorius Traffic Enforcement - DisableTriggersEffect looks like it could focus on Backup abilities? Detain as a keyword action probably doesn't need special treatment.
1. (Uk) That's No Moonmist - Can use the existing "FrontFace" property.
1. (Uk) Praetorhoof Behemoth - Adds number of revealed cards to number of matching cards in zones. Should be doable.
1. (Uk) Unknown Event Shores - Complicated, but the same support is needed for Cryptic Spires.
1. (Uk) Syr Konrad's Squire - Would probably work fine as separate abilities. 
1. (Uk) Life at Stake - Similar to Wheel of Misfortune
1. (Uk) Investi-Gate - Just choose and create two of the ten guildgates?
1. (Uk) The Inspector Inspector - Should be possible with ETBReplacements...
1. (Uk) The Zassacre Zirl - Removing a card's commander status is now totally do-able; (See "You're In Command", Tier 0)
1. (Uk) The Keeper of Kaldra - Companion effect can be written out manually, should work fine.
1. (Uk) The Keeper of Four Scythes - Scythe tokens not defined in rules, but could just be scripted normally.
1. (Uk) Hosting Season - Can ignore the date conditions since they'll never apply again.
1. (Uk) Year-End Review - Might be tricky to choose a card in different ways across three specific zones, but commander promotion is supported.
1. (Uk) Higher Level Zone Monster - Three ETB replacements in one, but should all be possible?
1. (Uk) Rideable Mantis - Unsure if you can use SaddledThisTurn in an xCount.
1. (Uk) The Bean - (Plane) Altered for second printing. May be worth a variant print?
1. (Uk) Black Lotus Lounge - (Plane)
1. (Uk) City Hall - (Plane)
1. (Uk) Shy Town - (Plane)

1. (Uk) Probability Flux - (Plane)

1. (Uk) That's Enough Slices - (Phenomenon) Or rather, "Phenome-nom". Could potentially add support for "flavor type-lines". Functionally it's fine.




#### Rerolling Dice (statically)
(Difficult, but feature is needed for some legal UNF like Monitor Monitor and Xenosquirrels)
1. Clam-I-Am - Option to reroll threes.
1. Wall of Fortune
1. Snickering Squirrel
1. (See also: Socketed Sprocketer, Tier 2)
1. (See also: "Rerolling Dice (using the stack)", Tier 4.)

#### Card Packs
(We have Booster Tutor. MakeCard can probably support these?)
1. Summon the Pack
1. Opening Ceremony
1. (Uk) Unknown Event - (Phenomenon)

#### Doesn't Actually Do Anything
1. (P) Abbot of the Sacred Meeple
1. (P) Spuzzem Strategist - Unless R&D's Secret Lair is implemented and they're playing Floral Spuzzem...

#### City in a Bottle Effect
(i.e. cares about cards that were printed in one or more specific expansions)
1. (Uk) Crux of Mirrodin
1. (Uk) Sheoldred's Terror - May change if Argentum is revisited
1. (Uk) Delphia, Undecided
1. (See also: "Set Matters", Tier 2)

#### Commander-tron Lands
(Urzatron lands have special support, but could probably be scripted without it.)
1. (Uk) Command Mine
1. (Uk) Command Power Plant

#### Choose and create random card from a list
(ChooseCardNameEffect should be able to do this, and CopyPermanent with "DefinedName$ NamedCard" looks like it will work.)
1. (P) (Uk) Who's That Praetor?
1. (Uk) Form of the Stax Player
1. (Uk) The Crab Queen
1. (Uk) The Disciple of Vess
1. (Uk) The Scholar of Seas

1. (Uk) The Wise Sable


### Tier 2
**Spiritually works within rules, new variations on existing features, and/or minor engine changes needed.**

1. Burning Cinder Fury of Crimson Chaos Fire - Taps trigger needs a way to reference the tapping player that triggered it.
1. Ricochet - Dice roll needs a "RememberLowestPlayer$" flag, plus one to make players reroll until ties are broken.
1. Free-Range Chicken - Might be possible to use YouRolledThisTurn with a ResultSVar? Unsure of the exact syntax.
1. Team Spirit - Defined player logic needs something like TargetedAndTeam.
1. Psychic Network - Top cards of decks visible to all opponents. Maybe not by holding it against the player's head but revealing it would work fine.
1. Get a Life - Exchange life with teammates. Unclear how this exchange works with more than 2 players on a team, but could probably dig that info up somewhere.
1. Curse of the Fire Penguin - Enchantment that replaces typeline, stats, and textbox. Unsure if this is a different layer than normal.
1. Six-y Beast - May need its own AI flag. It would want to favor higher numbers both when placing counters and guessing them. Also needs to account for counter-doublers in play.
1. By Gnome Means - "Choose any kind of counter a printed card refers to"
1. Rules Lawyer - Think there are a few complications to just skipping over SBA's, but seemed doable.
1. Kindly Cognician - Text matters, but only the Oracle text, not the printed text like most Un-cards.
1. Socketed Sprocketer - Already have diceroll storage from Centaur of Attention; need uninstall as a cost and a Monitor Monitor-esque dice replacement that uses the uninstalled die as the replacement value.
1. Spike, Tournament Grinder - Wishes for banned cards.
1. Squirrel-Powered Scheme - +2 to all dice rolls. Might be possible with current replacement effects?
1. Far Out - Makes Modal Choices into "Choose one or more". Maybe just a replacement effect on Charm?
1. Animate Object - Effect doesn't really care what the object is. Could just be a token. Might be fun to have a selection of images of random household items to represent the token. (But also Stickers)
1. Pie-Eating Contest - Can't physically eat food to pay the X-cost, but can still sacrifice food tokens.
1. Tug of War - Start subgame with 3 chosen cards in battlefield.
1. (P) Ral's Vanguard - Vanguard with "Requirement"
1. (P) Enroll in the Coalition - Player is a Flagbearer.

1. (P) Everlasting Lich - "Can't die."
1. (P) Swarm of Locus - Creature with Land Type
1. (P) Witty Demon - Starting deck size compared to minimum, similar to Yorion.

1. (P) Kaya, Ghost Haunter - Haunt target creature, target haunted creature.

1. (P) Seek Bolas's Counsel - Planeswalk in a non-planechase game.
1. (P) Rift - Can start in your opening hand.
1. Snow Mercy - Cost of Tap, Untap, Tap, Untap, Tap. 
1. Princess Twilight Sparkle - Unclear if everybody winning is the same as a draw, but otherwise works fine within the rules. Shame the cards it depends on don't.
1. (P) Creepy Crawler - "Afraid" status. Needs to know about applicable cards even if they left play already.
1. (P) Catch of the Day - Multiple chosen modes to specify abilities and stats as it enters. May work as is?
1. (P) Don't Worry About It - Animate dead works. Dunno if a hidden zone does, though.
1. (P) Essence of Ajani - Emblem spell.
1. (P) Knight of Lost Causes - "Way behind" state.
1. (P) Lifening Elemental - Creature that splices onto spell. Might work as-is?
1. (P) Liliana's Other Contract // Liliana's Undead Minion - Think it works in the rules, but may need some hack to display it face up when it transforms.
1. (P) Night of the Flying Merfolk - Bedtime Story, puts lore counters on only at end step.
1. (P) No-Regrets Egret - Serum Powder exists, but its implementation is hard-coded.

1. (P) Orb of Origin - Brings back Mono and Continuous artifact types and their functions.

1. (P) TL;DR - Check if card has non-keyword abilities.
1. (P) The Many Deeds of Belzenlok - Copy specific numbered chapter ability from a Saga.

1. (P) Wormhole Warp - Reveal cards from sideboard at random until...
1. (P) Your Wish is My Command - Choose an extra mode for a spell cast this way.
1. (Uk) Agoraphobic Phyrexian - Could reasonably be adapted to affect the Planechase plane instead of the Unknown Event plane. Should be possible to RemoveAllAbilities from a Plane?

1. (Uk) Occupation of Llanowar - Control Point battle type.
1. (Uk) Phyrexian Incubator - Properties of back face of card in library.

1. (Uk) Ring Out - Unsure if TriggerZones supports Library.
1. (Uk) Soul Drainer - Resets commander damage
1. (Uk) Triple Threat - Triples commander damage

1. (Uk) Simic, Value Engine - Count opponent's lands played and cards drawn last turn.
1. (Uk) Power Level Analyzer - Difference between two players' chosen numbers. Could probably modify logic from The Toymaker's Trap.

1. (Uk) The Fish Brewer - Panharmonicon, but tap fish to increase number of triggers.
1. (Uk) Irrefutable Evidence - Triggers when chosen for Collect Evidence
1. (Uk) The Sprinkler of Stardust - There's probably some reason Magar couldn't be written this way...
1. (Uk) The Pleasant Taxer - Taxes searching a library.
1. (Uk) The Karst, Enchanted - Different toughness and different card types while searching.
1. (Uk) Genevieve, Conniving Dragon - Party die. X-Math for number of sides on a regular die roll?
1. (Uk) Artist Alley - (Plane) Choose card with favorite art. Would have to work on the honor system. AI can pick randomly.
1. (Uk) Quest Compleated Beast - Fear of Sleep Paralysis brought some "can't remove counters" support, but doesn't yet include players.
1. (Uk) The Tokenator - Token's power and toughness is any combination that totals a certain value.
1. (Uk) The Weekly Princess - "Stops being day or night" - shouldn't be tough but needs a couple tweaks to work.
1. (Uk) Zimone's Homework - Similar to prime matters, but Fibonacci, lazy caterer's sequence, and square numbers matter instead.
1. (Uk) The Archenemy's Charm - Set scheme in motion in non-archenemy game.
1. (P) Second City - "Spend this mana only to cast your second spell in a turn."
1. (Uk) Htbr, Racetrack Referee - Can't cast spells using alternative costs. Might be doable through CantBeCast.

1. (Uk) Yet Another Night in Vegas - Reset chosen charm modes.
1. (Uk) You and Ooze Army? - Count creature types across all non-changelings. Similar to Embiggen?
1. (Uk) New Magic Game Plus - Needs a way to leave itself in exile after restarting the game. (Currently can only ignore cards in one zone at a time.)
1. (Uk) Out of Town - Unsure if there's an easy way to refer to the owner of an exiled card in a later trigger.


#### Unique but Simple Keywords
(These have custom keywords or named mechanics that could probably be reproduced within a card script. See "Keyword or Mechanic Recreated via Card Script", Tier 0.5)
1. (P) Squidnapper - Ransom keyword ability, a cost an opponent may pay statically to nullify an ongoing effect.
1. (P) Spellmorph Raise Dead - Basically morph for instants and sorceries.
1. (P) Bear with Set's Mechanic - Aggressive keyword. Similar to Last Night Together? Could possibly do it through a unique effect like Gollum, Obsessed Stalker.
1. (P) Avacyn's Collar, the Symbol of Her Church - Shackle keyword is just Equip for enemy creatures.
1. (P) Arcanum Things - Equipment swap keyword.
1. (P) Boltfire - Flashforward, flashback but card goes to bottom of library.
1. (P) Forbidden - Limit to 0 copies per deck. See current implementation of Gleemox, Tier 0.5.

1. (Uk) The Vegetable Car - "Onionfect", generates food tokens instead of dealing damage.
1. (Uk) Shen, Wish Granter - "Scatter the Dragonstorm Globes" keyword action is trivial except for the need to track it globally. Could use an emblem maybe?
1. (Uk) You're Toast - "Manifest Bread", like Manifest Dread except the manifested card becomes a food and can't be turned face up.

(Can probably be tested for with existing tools.)
1. (Uk) Theopholos, Order Acolyte

1. (Uk) Auntie Flint
1. (Uk) Mzed, Mercenary Leader
1. (Uk) Mr. Wiggles, Helpful Butterfly - (Also tutor to battlefield before game starts?)

1. (Uk) Arcbound Mamba - Poison Modular, +1/+1 counters placed on players by it become poison counters.

1. (Uk) Shadowmoor Draw Spell - Untap Convoke. 
1. (Uk) Farseeing Flockmate - Flying backup, variant of backup that gives flying counters.

1. (Uk) Devoted Abzan
1. (Uk) Devoted Sultai
1. (Uk) Devoted Temur
1. (Uk) Devoted Jeskai
1. (Uk) Devoted Mardu

#### Unique but Simple Costs

1. (Uk) That Which Was Compleated - Gaining poison counters as a cost.
1. (Uk) Chicago Loop - Reduce speed as an X-cost.

##### Commander Enchantment
(Enchant commander, but remains attached in all face up zones. Animate Dead seems like precedent.)

1. (Uk) Taught by Vito
1. (Uk) Taught by Bruce Tarl
1. (Uk) Taught by Surrak

1. Emcee
1. Rod of Spanking

1. (Uk) Trash Panda - Also "Opponent dredge".
1. (Uk) X, Mystery Racer

#### Other Un-Games
(It would be fun to include concurrent games running in other tabs. Aside from that, seeing only the current game misses the spirit of the card but technically works fine, and these would otherwise be in Tier 6 or 7.)
1. Side Quest
1. Exit Through the Grift Shop
1. (See also: "Ass Whuppin", Tier 0.5)

#### Turn Over Card
(Transform if it's a DFC, becomes a 2/2 if it's a normal card, splits up melded cards...)
1. Very Cryptic Command D - Also put card in controller's hand
1. (HTR) Optimus Prime, Inspiring Leader

#### Un-Cards
(Looks for Silver Bordered or Acorn cards, but not playtest or Heroes cards. This category probably needs to be defined anyway.)
1. Everythingamajig B
1. Underdome
1. (See also: Spatula of the Ages, Tier 0.5)

#### Set Matters
(The wording of these often varies and it's sometimes unclear how reprints should be treated. Tempted to throw them all in tier 4.)
1. (HTR) Heroes of Kamigawa - "Name printed in a Kamigawa expansion". Maybe a variation on Apocalypse Chime's set filter, to include reprints? Also booster pack, but of a specific type. May also need future-proofing against new Kamigawa sets.
1. (HTR) Keeper of the Secret Lair - Another set filter like above, but matching the set of the current print.
1. (Uk) Across the Multiverse - Only includes the main set, no bonus sheets.
1. (Uk) Must Be Knights - Specifically printings from Enchanting Tales (WOT).
1. (See also: War of the Spark, Tier 0)

1. (Uk) Barce, Friend Finder - Partner with any legendary creature with 0-1 colors in color identity.
1. (Uk) The Knight of Land Drops - Partner with any legendary knight.

1. (HTR) Ormacar, Relic Wraith - Partners with a legendary noncreature artifact.

##### Spell Commander
(From the Unknown Event in Barcelona, 2023. These are meant to use the ruling that mono-color legendaries all have Partner in Limited Commander events, which isn't currently implemented. Also they all have normalized name collisions.)

1. (Uk) Clear, the Mind
1. (Uk) Ransack, the Lab
1. (Uk) Lava, Axe
1. (Uk) Rampant, Growth

1. (Uk) The Highland Runner - Also beginning of first upkeep trigger.

1. (P) Keeper of the Crown // Coronation of the Wilds - {L}, one mana from a legendary source.
1. (P) Yawgmoth's Day Planner - Mana produced by abilities that caused you to lose life.

#### Unknown Event Team
(During the Philadelphia 2023 Unknown Event, players were split into two teams. These cards changed behavior based on which team you were on. Could be imitated by having the player pick a team once then retain that for all cards.) (They did it again in 2025.)
1. (Uk) Unclaimed Cat
1. (Uk) Unclaimed Bird
1. (Uk) Unclaimed Blessing
1. (Uk) Tricky Mage

#### Match Score matters
1. (P) Ruff, Underdog Champ
1. (Uk) Fear of Going 0-2 Drop

These both enter with a sealed booster "under" them, and open it upon dealing combat damage. Could do something like Mountain Mover - get a booster's cards, put all the cards from it face down in exile, then reveal them later.
1. Stocking Tiger
1. (Uk) The Chaos Keeper



### Tier 3
**Possible to implement, but needs whole new features and/or substantial engine changes.**

1. The Ultimate Nightmare of Wizards of the Coast® Customer Service - Y and Z costs. Comet Storm is functionally the same 99% of the time, but why implement this at all if you're not accounting for the other 1%?
1. Collector Protector - Giving away a card. Could work similar to Ante. Only really meaningful in limited and adventure-like formats.
1. Gleemax - Control all targets.
1. Magic Word - Choose arbitrary word, whisper it as cost. Could make it another zero cost but loses spirit of card.
1. The Grand Calcutron - Hands are all public, ordered, have to be played in order, and cards added to hand are put at a position chosen by the player.
1. Infernius Spawnington III, Esq. - Number of cards "revealed" this turn. 
1. Goblin Blastronauts - "Copy the spell, ability, or Attraction visit that caused you to roll that die." Might be possible to get this in RollDiceEffect and pass it on?
1. Sole Performer - Taps for {T}{T}, a resource used to pay {T} costs. 
1. (P) Metagamer - Could just hard-code the list since the errata promised in the rulings is still forthcoming. If/when it does happen though, would need to be maintained, or a solution for auto-updating it would need to be implemented.
1. (P) Do-Over - Restart the turn. Possible with Undo Restore logic?
1. (P) Memory Bank - Affects future game in match. See also, "Between Games" in Tier 4.
1. (P) High Troller - All targets chosen randomly. (Number of targets still chosen by player)
1. (P) Mana Abundance - ReplaceMana, except it changes who gets it.
1. (P) Siege Elemental - Untapped creatures can't block, tapped creatures can.
1. (P) Maro's Gone Nuts - "Double any effect that doubles." No catch-all way to detect this but there aren't that many effects that this applies to...
1. (P) Zymm, Mesemeric Lord - Opponent orders their hand, reveals it one by one until you stop them.
1. (P) Weaponized Scrap - Upgrade. Similar to mutate for artifacts? Somewhat different merge rules though.
1. Decorated Knight // Present Arms - Swap deck with one outside the game, while still being able to draw from it. Could possibly use the extra zones used by Backup Plan?
1. (P) Boulder Jockey - {D}, a cost that when paid, reduces your potential land drops for the turn. 
1. (P) Cleaver Blow - Multicleave.
1. (P) Defender of the Queue - Positioning keyword, orders battlefield from left to right and affects "adjacent" creatures.
1. (P) Heart of a Duelist - Could show the library zone face down and let player pick the card to be drawn?
1. (P) Plant a Sapling // Fully-Grown Treefolk - Transform while in library.
1. (P) Snap Judgment - Winning the game wins the match.
1. (P) Tax Taker - Whenever an opponent pays a cost imposed or increased by one of your cards.

1. (Uk) Sort of ____ and ____ - Assemble a combat trigger from two chosen modes.
1. (Uk) Incubation Triformer - Transform a transformed phyrexian token to a "third side" which is a 3/3.
1. (Uk) Polis the Planeshifter - Copies abilities from a random planechase plane, activates corresponding chaos effects and changes planes via activated ability.
1. (Uk) Shahrazad and Sindbad - "If there haven't been any subgames this match"
1. (Uk) Unicycling Atomaton - Hand Backup, gives abilities to card in hand until end of turn, and its +1/+1 counter when it "eventually" comes into play. 
1. (Uk) Huge Truck - Permanently gains abilities shared by a backup ability. Includes backup variants too.
1. (Uk) Shedding Snake - Resets command tax. Probably shouldn't affect "times cast from the command zone this game", though.
1. (Uk) Lona, Tracker of the Known - Number of english sets a card has been printed in. Bit messy but possibly do-able.
1. (Uk) Margle, Cousin of Yargle - "Can't gain abilities"
1. (Uk) Spice Rack - Maximum Commander size. Sounds like an SBA; Could maybe simulate but would want to suppress commander replacement effect.
1. (Uk) Banned Eldraine Card - Choose an additional cost that determines which card it becomes (perpetually).
1. (Uk) Takesies // Backsies - "Treat all counters as -1/-1 counters".
1. (Uk) Trampled Lotus - Activate up to three mana abilities of opponents' lands. "Splitter Second" effectively makes this a mana ability.
1. (Uk) The Asker of More Mana - RaiseCost can cover spells and abilities, but not resolution stuff like UnlessCosts.
1. (Uk) Interrogation Robot - Trivial, but partly dependent on card in this tier. (See "Who // What // When // Where // Why")
1. (Uk) The Horizon Seeker - Count unique keywords and ability words.
1. (Uk) The Convincing General - Make two creature types interchangeable.
1. (Uk) The Magical City, New - Land as commander.
1. (Uk) Mad Labs - (Phenomenon) Choose a keyword counter.
1. (P) Glimpse, the Unthinkable - "Can't be chosen" and name can't be chosen while in play. Also normalized name collision.
1. (P) Muraganda Eldrazi - "Counts as having no abilities.", but still has them. Also Primeval Counter.
1. (P) Omnipresent Impostor - Can be found when searching library regardless of criteria. Has all names. Basic supertype.
1. (P) Oddric, Lunar Marquis - Eater-of-Virtue-ing a specific triggered ability by text. Granting Devoid and Changeling will need special handling since that normally doesn't work due to layers. (See "Slivdrazi Monstrosity", Tier 0)
1. (P) Panglacial Shinobi - "Library ninjutsu" - have to swap it with an attacking creature. Also Panglacial Worm-likes, Tier 2.
1. (P) Toofer, Keeper of the Full Grip - "Card Advantage", the net change in relative hand size between you and all opponents when a spell resolves.
1. (Uk) Second Stage of Magic Design - Looks for unique Keywords and Ability words.
1. (Uk) Fear of Unsleeved Decks - Could look at the player's card back choice and see if it's the default?
1. (Uk) The Fearsome Flock - Split second on the level up ability. Lets you activate abilities of opponents' cards.
1. (Uk) Oozeavite - Keyword counters that also grant +1/+1
1. (Uk) The Cosplayzer - Changes first letter of name (or adds letter onto beginning of name?). Also, "The first time each turn an ability of this creature is activated or triggered"
1. (Uk) Seventh Stage of Magic Design - Can get most of the way there with existing spell, ability, and mana doublers, but mana abilities with side effects like Chromatic Sphere might be a leap.
1. (Uk) Jiffy, Vehicle Repairer - Prevents Jump-start from exiling cards cast through it. Unsure if there's comparable precedent for suppressing a specific replacement effect.
1. (Uk) Just a Li'l Guy - Preeminent stat modifier.
1. (Uk) The Command Zone - (Plane) Unlike "Shedding Snake" (see above), explicitly resets the number of times a commander has been cast from the command zone.
1. (Uk) Twenty Lessons - Casts spell without paying mana cost, but specifies the value of X if the spell has an X-cost.
1. (Uk) Vamping Vampire - ETB looks back at the number of counters on a card before it was cast from exile (i.e. LKI after two zone changes not one). Might be able to hack something with a cast trigger?
1. (Uk) Blu, Mansion Prince - Create a token that's a copy of half of a randomly chosen room card.
1. (Uk) Fear of Forgetting Names - Remove name from a permanent. 
1. (Uk) Surprise, Nerd - Replace pump effects.



#### Cast Cards as Other Cards
(Form of the Mulldrifter rules that the Evoke cost may be paid. Others do not rule Alternative Costs either way.)
1. Richard Garfield, Ph.D. - Any card with same mana cost. Also cast cards cannot be reused; it's been ruled that this persists even if it leaves and reenters.
1. (P) Form of the Mulldrifter - Specifically as Mulldrifter.
1. (P) Starting Town NPC - Adds Adventure onto card.
1. (P) (Uk) The Colossal Dreadmaw - Specifically as Colossal Dreadmaw.
1. (Uk) Elonc, Perfect Clone - As a copy of your commander. 
1. (Uk) Fourth Stage of Magic Design - Same as Richard Garfield but only once per turn. Unclear if they share a list of chosen cards.

#### Super Haste
(Essentially a Pact, but as a keyword and the cost can be paid any time on the next turn. Unclear how this interacts with cost adjustments. FAQ also adamant that Super haste is not a form of Haste.)
1. Rocket-Powered Turbo Slug
1. (Uk) Need for Speed (Not the Odyssey One)

#### Text Boxes
(Usually just refers to all the abilities and keywords, and Exchange of Words does this in black border. But it has different rulings in Un-Games, where flavor text and watermarks also matter.)
1. Do-It-Yourself Seraph
1. Pheobe, Head of S.N.E.A.K. - (Also Flavor Text Matters)
1. Grusilda, Monster Masher - Merges two dead creatures into one living one.
1. It Came from Planet Glurg - Becomes a copy of X different creatures.

#### Multi-Split Cards
(Most split card logic currently assumes only two parts)
1. Who // What // When // Where // Why
1. (P) Smelt // Herd // Saw
1. (P) There // They're // Their

#### Phases out of Turn
1. Clocknapper - Steal phase from opponent
1. (P) Throat Wolf - Create its own combat phase during opponent's turn (Also Firstest Strike)
1. (P) Chronobot - Switch upkeep steps with an opponent
1. (P) Runed Terror - "Players take their phases sequentially"

#### Last or Triple Strike
(Might not be that difficult, but would want it to only show up in the phase UI when relevant)
1. Extremely Slow Zombie
1. Garbage Elemental F
1. Three-Headed Goblin
1. (See also: Throat Wolf)

#### Activate in Any Zone
(Including while it's in your library and you're about to search for a card with certain characteristics...)
1. _____ - (Also flavor text matters. Also having no name by default.)
1. Shellephant

#### People Outside the Game Joining the Game
(Could be done by introducing an AI.)
1. Better Than One - (Needs two-headed giant rules support.)
1. Kindslaver
1. (Uk) The Egotistical Velociraptor

#### Extend Duration of Effects
(Particularly "until end of turn" or "this turn" effects)
1. Staying Power
1. Grand Marshal Macie - Choose an ongoing effect, it lasts as long as this remains tapped.

#### Legacy
(Effects that call for the player to make a choice before the game, which is stored with the card and affects its text or characteristics. This often involves marking the physical card. Once in-game, these choices or markings are copyable attributes.)
1. (P) Inspirational Antelope - Also keyword or ability word matters.
1. (P) Gold Mine - Mark nodes during the game, they stay marked in future games.
1. (P) Built Bear - Spree-like effect where you mark abilities and characteristics with point values. Total points marked determines mana cost.
1. (Uk) Common Curve Filler - Choose and write a number; chosen number sets power, toughness, and cost.
1. (Uk) Awoken Nephilim - Choose a Nephilim, acts as a legendary copy of it.
1. (Uk) Your Mana Rock - Cryptic Spires but an Artifact.
1. (P) Convention Maro - Choose a trigger requirement and an X-math function. Also watermark matters, landscape matters, and artist matters.
1. (Uk) The Fifth Alias - List of five other cards in your deck. Unclear what to do if you have multiple copies.
1. (Uk) The Faction Dragon - "Choose a faction" meaning clan, guild, etc. Mana cost is the faction's mana colors. Also the chosen faction's watermark matters.
1. (Uk) Your Favorite Missing Character - Any two colors, up to three creature types, an arbitrary name, and one of four listed abilities.
1. (See Also: "Cryptic Spires", Black Border)
1. (See Also: "The Prismatic Piper", "Faceless One", and "Clara Oswald", Black Border)

#### Cards Outside the Battlefield become Copies
1. (P) Bombardment - Transform your into Missiles. 
1. (P) Transcantation - Transform spell on the stack.

#### Card Becomes Another Card's Back Face
1. (P) Blurry Visionary - Turn two cards into MDFC.
1. (P) Werewhat - Makes another creature into its own back face, becomes TDFC.

#### Arbitrary Names
1. (P) A Girl and Her Dogs - Name the tokens anything you want.
1. (Uk) Your Favorite Character - Name of a Magic character. Probably best adapted as picking any string for the name, unless Vorthos (Tier 5) gets added. Rest of it seems possible to script, though complicated.
1. (Uk) ______ - Perpetual name change built from two chosen types and the player's name. Also no name by default. Also name conflict (lack-of-name conflict??) with _____.
1. (Uk) Naming Screen - Arbitrary four-letter names for tokens.

#### Rulebreaker
(If this is your commander, loosens color identity or deck building restrictions.)
1. (Uk) Arvad of the Weatherlight
1. (Uk) Daxiver, Izzet Electromancer
1. (Uk) Hadran, Naya Sunseeder
1. (Uk) Valko Indorian, Researcher
1. (Uk) The Paradise Bird

1. (Uk) Dan, Shrewd Trader - Bargain any permanent
1. (Uk) Stroopwafel Cafe - (Plane) Top card of library, as a food. May be "In Multiple Zones at Once", Tier 4.

#### Face Down Commanders
(At the Chicago 2024 Unknown Event, games were played with Commanders face down until first played. This could be implemented as a game mode or variant. These cards interact with that mechanic.)
1. (Uk) Illuminating Detective
1. (Uk) Educated Detective
1. (Uk) Demon Detective
1. (Uk) Aggressive Detective
1. (Uk) Growing Detective
1. (See also: "Command From the Shadows", Tier 5)

#### Change Game Piece Type
1. Claire D'Loon, Joy Sculptor - Tokens become "Tokens that are also Cards", which count as tokens but can exist outside the battlefield. Mystery Booster apparently has "Token Cards" (See: Time Sidewalk); are those the same thing?
1. (P) Intangible Vibes - Reminder text suggests this would continue to apply to creatures as they leave the battlefield. Rules text is not written as such. Cancelled out by Claire D'Loon?

#### Affects Gameplay Trackers
1. (P) Naturalize 2 - Destroy emblems, monarch, city's blessing, dungeons, day, night, and the initiative. And any future trackers, like Start your Engines.
1. (Uk) Clear, Fair Magic - Destroys all of those, plus planes, schemes, vanguards, bounties and elite creatures (if those ever get added), or conspiracies.

1. Dr. Julius Jumblemorph
1. Surgeon ~General~ Commander

##### Host Cards
1. Ordinary Pony
1. Crafty Octopus
1. Strutting Turkey

#### Print Characteristics
(Main complication with these is the golden rule of Un-games, that these characteristics are derived from the printing, not the central Oracle info that normal characteristics use. They may vary from one print to another based on language, edition, or just for stylistic reasons. One permanent can also have multiple sets of these merged into one by something like Grusilda. Only saving grace here keeping this out of Tier 5 is that we could in theory extract most of these from the Scryfall API...)

1. Super Secret Tech - Premium
1. Abstract Iguanart - First letter of artist's name
1. Park Map - Art
1. (HTR) Collectigull // Only the Best - Booster Fun
1. (HTR) Treizeci, Sun of Serra - Retro Frame
1. Stet, Draconic Proofreader - First letter of card name, first letter of player's name, and can also delete letters from either.
1. Topdeck the Halls - Premium, promos, alternate frames, and the vaguely defined "alternate art".
1. (P) Lutri, Pauper Otter - Color of expansion symbol. Not necessarily synonymous with rarity if counting playtest cards...

##### Artist Matters
(Forge does keep track of this for most sets.)

1. Erase (Not the Urza's Legacy One)
1. Fascist Art Director

1. (Uk) The Water Maro
1. (Uk) Chic // Ago

##### Text Box Text Matters
1. Tainted Monkey
1. Punctuate
1. Pygmy Giant
1. Meddling Kids

##### Rules Text Matters
1. capital offense
1. Nocturno of Myra's Marvels
1. Third Stage of Magic Design - (Or type line)

##### Reminder Text Matters
1. Duh
1. Old Guard

##### Flavor Text Matters
1. Ineffable Blessing A
1. Plot Armor
1. Carnivorous Death-Parrot - Does this become an unpayable cost if copied onto a card without flavor text?
1. (Uk) The Rhystic Storyteller - Also deck can't use sleeves? Could override their card back choice...

##### Border Color Matters
(Border color is currently supported on an edition level, but not for individual cards. Some cards that use it to look for silver borders have also since been errata'd to include acorns.)
1. Kinght of the Kitchen Sink A
1. Ineffable Blessing C

##### Watermark Matters

1. S.N.E.A.K. Dispatcher

1. Hammerfest Boomtacular
1. Druid of the Sacred Beaker

### Tier 4
**Either poorly defined rules, or other logistical complications exist. Often can be figured out case-by-case but general solutions are hard to come up with.**

1. B.F.M. (Big Furry Monster) - Maybe "Can only enter the battlefield simultaneously with its other half," plus a SA to cast them both, plus a replacement that merges them?
1. S.N.O.T. - Unclear what sticking them together means. Merging permanents perhaps?
1. Graveyard Busybody - "All graveyards are also your graveyards." (Also Flavor Text Matters)
1. Over My Dead Bodies - Creatures in graveyards can attack as though they were on the battlefield.
1. Mary O'Kill - Switching places with another card. Conveys all statuses, like an advanced Ninjutsu? Gets a dozen times more complicated when someone drops Conspiracy and names Killbot.
1. Split Screen - Multiple Libraries, choose which one each time you interact with one.
1. Mobile Clone - Copying the physically visible characteristics and modifiers of a card and baking them into the copy.
1. Trigger Happy - Trigger an ability. Sounds possible on paper, and rulings cover a lot of edge cases. May just have to try it and see if it breaks.
1. Icing Manipulator - +1/+1 counters are also food tokens. Not even sure how the UI for this would even work. Summon in food tokens to represent them, then add or remove them in lockstep with the counters B.O.B. style?
1. Log Flume - (Attraction) Creatures in a log together can't be blocked unless they're all blocked, and spells that target one of them target all of them.
1. (P) Animate Spell - Enchants a spell on the stack, turns it into a creature.
1. (P) Queue of Beetles - Turns Stack into a FIFO queue.
1. (P) Seasoned Weaponsmith - Creature can be attacked directly
1. (P) Interplanar Brushwagg - Neutral creature that attacks on its own.
1. (P) Soulmates - "Enchant two creatures"
1. (P) Louvaq, the Aberrant - Different, more complicated definition of "Modified" in its reminder text. Unclear if this should be overwritten by game rules. If so, would fall into Tier 1.
1. (P) Pithing Spyglass - Remove ability words and their corresponding abilities. Could possibly search for them in a trigger or ability description?
1. (HTR) Elusen, the Giving - "Whenever a player donates a permanent to another player". Whenever a spell or ability they control would give a permanent they control to another player?
1. (P) Brigid, Who's Seen Some Stuff - Unsure if granting a keyword that grants keywords creates a dependency or layering issue. Also Nimble keyword.
1. (Uk) Chancellor of the Mulligan - Mulligan as an action mid-game. Unclear if this should be affected by format's mulligan rules, or its interaction with Serum Powder.
1. (Uk) The Beleaguered Boxer - Would need special handling in the deck editor, turning a constructed deck into sealed, preventing future editing, then modifying it from in game. Complicated but not impossible.
1. (P) Terry Pin, Turboturtle - Unclear if this includes keywords like Equip, or just when those exact words are printed in the ability text.
1. (Uk) The Zonian Brawler - "Bite" effects matter. (Also Rulebreaker, Tier 3)
1. (Uk) The Game-Changing Host - "Anything that could have changed The Game-Changing Host on the turn it enters applies retroactively." Also game-changer matters.


#### Rerolling Dice (using the stack)
(Would probably be best to approximate these as static abilities)
1. Goblin Bookie - Also reflip coin.
1. Pippa, Duchess of Dice
1. Scooch - Even the rulings have no idea how this works.

#### Between Games
(Effects across multiple games of the same match is straightforward enough. Ideally could include rematches with adventure enemies or similar. Rematches in custom matches however gets iffy - what makes an AI the same individual? Name? Avatar? Human opponents can pose similar problems, and tracking this across different hosts becomes complicated.)
1. Double Dip
1. Double Take
1. Double Cross
1. Double Deal
1. Double Play
1. Ghazban Ogress - Number of games won today
1. Gus - Win streak against player
1. Time Machine

#### Converting Counters
(Move a counter, and convert it based on the destination's rules text and/or card types.)
1. Giant Fan
1. Everythingamajig A

#### Swap Player Places
(Exact implementations of these two would be straightforward. However, the FAQ for Unglued and the rulings of the latter suggest that these should swap more than what's described on the card.)
1. Mirror Mirror
1. Everythingamajig F

#### Lookahead
(Effects that classify cards, spells, or abilities based on what effects they could or would have upon resolution.)
1. Ambiguity - Reacts to counterspells or permanents that would enter with counters.
1. Proper Laboratory Attire - Identify cards that allow or require die rolls.
1. Mishra's Toy Workshop - Generates mana for token-creating abilities.
1. (Uk) The Countering Runner - Discounts spells that would counter things. (Also "Psychic Damage") (Also "Ready to Run", Tier 2)
1. (Uk) The Brewing Chef - "card that creates a token".

#### Memory
(The AI for "accidentally" forgetting certain bits of info is a bit weird conceptually but not impossible)
1. Squirrel Farm
1. My First Tome
1. Everythingamajig D
1. Memory
1. Common Courtesy - Remembering to ask permission. Possibly implement "Asking" by clicking on Common Courtesy between casting and passing priority?
1. (Uk) The Trivia Mastermind
1. (Uk) The Actualizer
1. (Uk) The Fact Checker - Also unclear scope for "If you would guess a card, instead just choose the outcome you want."

#### Attack Active Player
1. Party Crasher - Attacks during opponent's combat phase.
1. Evil Presents - Attacks own controller.

#### In Multiple Zones at Once
1. Yet Another Aether Vortex
1. Masterful Ninja
1. (P) All-You-Can-Eat Buffet - "The top card of your library is a Food token. It's still a card". The "card" part of the card isn't on the battlefield. Apparently meaning this is in two zones at once, with two separate sets of characteristics at once?

#### Time
(Can use the system clock, but the question is which player's clock to use when online)
1. Elvish House Party
1. Old-Fashioned Vampire - Does isitdarkoutside.com have an API?
1. Syr Cadian, Knight Owl
1. Spirit of the Season - Season of the year. Shifts the complication from timezones to regional calendars...
1. Some Disassembly Required - "If it's December", also distributing keyword abilities.
1. (Uk) May of the Machine - Checks if today is May 6th or May 7th.

#### Instant Permanent
1. (P) Visitor from Planet Q
1. (P) Lightning Colt
1. (See also: Blue Screen of Death, Tier 5)

#### Animate Zone
(Attaching an enchantment to a zone is a bit weird. The resulting creature in these cases doesn't seem to be all that complicated to handle in most cases, but some weird edge cases exist, especially with un-cards.)
1. Animate Library
1. Animate Graveyard

#### Knock-on Effects
(Cards that alter the existing game rules to work as written, and whose changes would influence black-border interactions. Could have a game flag to decide whether or not to use un-rules.)
1. Super-Duper Death Ray - Trample on an instant. Very similar to Flame Spill but nuances of it being a keyword need to be investigated. Option to assign more damage to target?
1. (P) Glade of the Pump Spells - Land with mana cost. Do-able on its own, but may have a knock-on effect for other cards.
1. (P) Madlands - Land with Madness. Played as a land drop when madness cost is paid.

#### Share attachment effects
(Could possibly get 90% there with a static ability meddling with EquippedBy or AttachedBy, but plenty of edge cases out there.)
1. Solaflora, Intergalactic Icon - Equipment, Auras, plus counters and stickers.
1. (Uk) The Kami Knight - Just Equipment. (Also "Can't be Goaded")

#### Make things into Planeswalkers without Loyalty Counters
1. (P) Abian, Luvion Usurper - You become a planeswalker, with your life as loyalty counters. B.O.B. style link again?
1. (P) Planeswalkerificate - Creature becomes a planeswalker with loyalty and toughness tied together. Unclear how it works with other toughness modifying effects.

#### Alters Counting
1. (P) Five Kids in a Trenchcoat - Counts as five creatures when counting creatures.
1. (Uk) The Multiplayer Nitpickers - Effects that count players see an extra one.

#### Combat damage uses the stack.
(Probably would first need support as a game rule.)
1. (P) Stack of Paperwork
1. (Uk) Rafi, Retro Racer - Also enables mana burn.

### Tier 5
**Theoretically possible to do digitally, but in practice there is no good way to do these in Forge**

1. R&D's Secret Lair - Would have to maintain separate cardscripts for every print that functions differently. 
1. Vorthos, Steward of Myth - Named character, appearing in art, name, or flavor text. Besides the art (see Art Elements below), would need the list of named characters and any variants of their name to look for.
1. Spelling Bee - Beyond the issues of "Text Matters" from Tier 3 and "Memory" from Tier 4, the biggest issue here is prompting a player to spell a word without showing them how to spell the word. Would need a Text-to-speech implementation.
1. (Uk) Hero's Uncle - Tutors legendary team up cards. List is short enough to hard code but having to maintain it would not be ideal.
1. (Uk) Minnea, Planar Tourist - Choose a plane, affects cards from chosen plane. Tagger has planes for artwork and character origins. That might cover enough?
1. (Uk) Command From The Shadows - Conspiracy that keeps commanders hidden until first played. Problem is we show commanders in the lobby before the game even starts. Could be its own separate game mode.
1. (Uk) The Mox Painter - Tournament legal moxen. Reminder text gives a fixed list, but not future proof. Also depends on a card in this tier (See: "Mox Lotus").
1. (Uk) Advanced Tactics - Puts all creatures onto a 5x5 grid and lets their controllers move them around. Unclear what happens when there's more than 25 creatures in play. Biggest hurdle would be the UI overhaul needed to actually display the grid.

#### Noninteger Numbers
1. Bosom Buddy
1. Little Girl
1. Flaccify
1. Cheap Ass
1. Smart Ass
1. Bad Ass
1. Dumb Ass
1. Fat Ass
1. Assquatch
1. Necro-Impotence
1. Wet Willie of the Damned
1. Mons's Goblin Waiters
1. Saute
1. Fraction Jackson
1. Supersize
1. Letter Bomb
1. Mox Lotus
1. City of Ass
1. Infinity Elemental
1. Just Desserts
1. Octo Opus
1. Omniclown Colossus // Pie-roclasm
1. Urza's Fun House

#### NonWUBRG Colors
(These could be done colorless like Sword of DnD)
1. Water Gun Balloon Game - Pink token (Also "Pop!" counters)
1. Gift Shop - Pink token, (Also Attraction and Stickers)
1. Push Your Luck - Pink token

#### Number or Text Adjustment
(There's no direct link between numbers within the text and numbers used in the script.)
1. Look at Me, I'm R&D
1. Magical Hacker
1. More or Less
1. Very Cryptic Command F
1. Truss, Chief Engineer
1. (Uk) You, Magic Playtester
1. (Uk) You, Iterative Playtester

#### Count Lines of Text
(Scryfall doesn't seem to carry this info.)
1. Lexivore
1. Frazzled Editor - Wordy (4+ lines of rules text)
1. Garbage Elemental A - Wordy
1. Alexander Clamilton - Wordy
1. Hardy of Myra's Marvels - Flavor Text
1. Meet and Greet "Sisay" - Flavor Text (Also Expansion Symbol Matters)
1. (Uk) Clamilton Estate - Wordy

#### Art Rampage
1. Our Market Research Shows That Players Like Really Long Card Names So We Made this Card to Have the Absolute Longest Card Name Ever Elemental
1. Garbage Elemental E

#### Art Elements
(If Scryfall included tagger tags in their API, these could go up to tier 3)
1. Knight of the Kitchen Sink C
1. Sly Spy B
1. Sly Spy D
1. Selfie Preservation
1. Acornelia, Fashionable Filcher
1. Don't Try This at Home
1. Ignacio of Myra's Marvels
1. Nightmare Moon - (Also, Friendship)
1. Pinkie Pie

#### Art Elements, (unsupported by tagger)
1. Bar Entry - Head above the bar in Bar Entry's art.
1. Jermane, Pride of the Circus - Four or more legs.
1. Assembled Ensemble - "artifact creature in its art"; could possibly cross together a bunch of other tags for artificial creature types.
1. (Uk) Unstickerify - The card that a playtest card is stickered onto. Might also consider Unfinity stickers?

#### Hat Wearing
(Tagger's "Hat" tag doesn't exactly fit this. Per ruling: "The creature that the card represents must be wearing a hat to have menace. A background character or a scale bird wearing a hat wouldn’t count." Could ignore that caveat and have it fit for the majority of cases though.)
1. Goblin Haberdasher
1. Hat Trick
1. Park Re-Entry
1. T.A.P.P.E.R.
1. Haberthrasher
1. Rat in the Hat
1. Goblin Girder Gang

#### Arbitrary Words
(Cards where to apply the rules, we'd need to maintain a list of all words in the player's language, because the AI doesn't know to complain if a player chooses "qwxbzrkl")
1. Goblin Cruciverbalist
1. Hangman - Guessing letters of a word is the easy part. Getting the AI to play along is harder. 

#### Time Limits
(Interacting with the Forge UI under time pressure will not be a fun experience for anyone. The AI being able to do it instantly just throws salt in the wound.)
1. Hot Fix
1. Modular Monstrosity
1. Scavenger Hunt - (Attraction)
1. Trivia Contest - (Attraction)
1. (Uk) Blue Screen of Death

#### Unknown Event Scoring
(At the Philadelphia 2023 Unknown Event, players were split into two teams. These cards, when played, scored points for your team. The whole event would have to be recreated for these to be relevant.) (They did more of this in 2025, too.)
1. (Uk) Good Knight
1. (Uk) Point to the Scoreboard
1. (Uk) Bad Knight
1. (Uk) Join the Winning Team
1. (Uk) Snapsail Rider - Affects point value for the surrounding match
1. (Uk) Take the High Ground
1. (Uk) Underdog Racer - Could be adapted per reminder text, but kinda loses the point of the card.

#### Unknown Event Meta-game Planes
(At the Minneapolis 2023 Unknown Event, Planechase-like planes were in effect across all games in the event. Some of these could be implemented as normal Planechase cards, but the ones here would not translate well.) (These currently aren't on Scryfall)
1. (Uk) The Library - Starting hand size.
1. (Uk) Yargle's Barge - Once per game activation.
1. (Uk) The Underworld - Once per game may-cast.
1. (Uk) Wizards of the Coast - Once per game may-cast. (Also Playtest Card matters, Tier 2)

#### Universes Beyond Setting
(Think tagger tags could support this)
1. (HTR) Byode, Inverse Sun
1. (Uk) Multiversal High Council - (Plane) Number of unique universes


### Tier 6
**Could at best do a rough imitation, partial implementation, or would require its own minigame to work digitally**

1. Sorry
1. Jalum Grifter
1. Frankie Peanuts
1. Cramped Bunker
1. Boomstacker
1. Devil K. Nevil
1. Tchotchke Elemental
1. Cover the Spot - (Attraction)
1. Squirrel Stack - (Attraction)
1. Chaos Wrap
1. Nerf War
1. Goblin Mime - Triggered by any dialog. Could at least watch for other dialog-costs being paid.
1. Phone a Friend - Could just be randomly chosen and/or let the opponent choose?
1. Yule Ooze - Could change the cost from eating food to sacrificing a Food to keep the spirit of the card, but that is a rules change.
1. Fluttershy - Stare down could be implemented as a designation. But even so, "creature with a tail" would make this at best a Tier 5.
1. (HTR) The Secret Lair - Can't implement accurately without knowing the secret word.
1. Autograph Book - Collect signatures from opponents? Adventure enemies? (Also Legacy, Tier 3.)
1. (Uk) The Clever Magician - Proposing a rule. Could cover a lot of ground functionally by just opening a text editor and letting them write their rule as a card script, to apply through an effect. UX for that implementation would be a lost cause though, and the AI would never be able to evaluate it.
1. (Uk) At Least It's a Dry Heat - Even without the geolocation needed to determine "sources on the east coast", tracking the causality of damage events through numbers would be Tier 4 at best.
1. (Uk) Drive to Work - Sharing fun facts about cards.
1. (Uk) Sorin's Remastered Manor - (Plane) Would need some combination of tags and types to form a criteria for "could be a horror movie monster".
