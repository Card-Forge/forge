## Modding and Development

With the addition of new planes in Adventure Mode, comes a framework to allow greater customization and even expansion of the available planes. The details behind the framework and each category can be found below. As well as a new section being built with some basic information on each piece of plane construction and modification. The sections will also define some Best Practices to be maintained.

### Getting Started

Modding Adventure mode comes in many fashions. From making small changes to a core plane, such as changing the music that plays on the overworld. To something as complex as an entirely new plane. Regardless of your intended goals, the first thing to do is set-up a back-up method. As any changes you haven't had incorporated into the main game, will potentially be lost on each update of Forge. Since this is a Git project, the method that will be recommended by this wiki, and referenced for the future, is simply to create your own git branch, and use a local repository to control all your files. It is also recommended to follow the directions to [set-up IntelliJ](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge/wiki/IntelliJ-setup), to manage your local files. (Again, this is the method that will be referenced elsewhere in this wiki.) 

### Tools

The following additional tools can also be very useful, or even mandatory, to have for your mod, depending on what all you want to do in your mod/addition.

**[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)**: If you want to modify or create any maps; (caves, dungeons, towns, etc.) Forge utilizes Tiled. If you want to learn more on this topic, you can find it in the [Create new Maps](https://github.com/Card-Forge/forge/wiki/Create-new-Maps) section of the Wiki.

**[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)**: Many of the art files such as the tilesets used in Tiled, are made in GIMP. (A free graphical manipulation program, similar to Photoshop.) While not required to work in Forge's files, if you want to create your own art assets, this is the program that will be used for examples in this Wiki.
