# Adding basic lands and special arts

You can add lands by clicking the tripple dots icon in the right top of the deck building interface.

Initially you only have access to jumpstart basic land arts - to get more, you need to purchase the landscape sketch books from the basic land shop (The Cartographers Guild).

# 40-card deck recommendation

40-card decks give you a much more predictable curve.

In a 40-card deck, each individual card has a 2.5% chance of being drawn.

In a 60-card deck, each individual card has a 1.6% chance of being drawn.

When you use a smaller deck, the significance of each individual card is much higher and will give you more predictable performance.

# Autosell

When you click a card that is not part of any decks, you get the option to move it to auto-sell.

The numbers in the interface indicate how many copies you have.

To sell the cards you have marked, go to any town and enter the Inn.
In the Inn, the middle icon of the coin called Sell (E) will sell all your cards you have marked to sell.

Individual card values vary by rarity and reputation with the town you sell them in.

Since dying will cause you to lose a percentage of your gold, you may want to not sell all your cards immediately.
