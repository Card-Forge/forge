# The Different Planes of Adventure Mode

In Adventure Mode, you can select different planes (AKA worlds) to experience. The default experience is the Shandalar plane, and is the basis of gameplay found in all the others. The other planes are community projects, and are in various states of completion. Below there is a list of each plane in the game (as of this writing), and it's status.

To change planes, open up Adventure Mode. On the main screen where you can either load a game or start a new one. Go to the Settings menu, and you will find a drop down on the top right with a list of the planes currently available. When changing planes, you will need to restart Forge to apply the change. Save files are unique to each plane, and will load back in when you change to the appropriate plane.

## Amonkhet

A plane set in the world of Amonkhet, and is intended to have new quests, story, enemies, etc. based on that Magic The Gathering plane.

**STATUS:** Very broken. Not recommended for play, unless you want to dip your head in and see a very different overworld map. Pretty much nothing else works properly. _You have been warned._


## Crystal Kingdoms

A plane with a focus on the Final Fantasy cards. Intended to have a unique story, quests, enemies, etc. based on the Final Fantasy games.

**STATUS:** Very pre-alpha. The plane 'works' but is almost identical to the default Shandalar plane. The big differences is new starting decks, and the card rewards in shops and from enemies, have a stronger Final Fantasy bent than usual.

## Innistrad

A plane set in the lore and world of Magic the Gathering's Innistrad plane. The card pool and enemies are limited to Innistrad, with some minor exceptions. There is also a distinctly different overworld, story, enemies, etc. Every map is new and unique compared to Shandalar.

**STATUS:** Technically alpha. Everything is 'functional' in that it is all closed off and separate from the Shandalar plane. The enemies are new, the quests include some base and some new (though the tutorial has some strong similarities). The shops are new-ish (they currently use the base shops, but with a limited card pool to just the plane. This is actively being changed to entirely new shops however, and should become notable in the next few updates.) Every town, dungeon, and cave is unique to Innistrad and been custom built for the plane. Every enemy is also new to Innistrad.

_HOWEVER_: Everything is still very early in design. Most of the biomes are empty. The new quests are limited. The shops under work. The story ends partway through the tutorial. The first bosses are being worked on. The enemies are few in number, but growing rapidly in development. Etc. This plane is best for short plays to see what is going on, but don't expect to spend much time here, Yet. That said, it is the community plane receiving the most work and most consistent updates. With changes coming at the minimum, monthly, preferably weekly.

In it's current state, expect to find bugs. if you do, please report them to Shenshinoman in the Forge Discord.

## Shandalar

The base plane, where all the magic happens, and where the dev team members working on Adventure generally focus their efforts. The story is mostly complete, but there _is_ further work planned. Everything works, and you can easily spend dozens of hours, or more, in this plane.

**STATUS:** Fully functional and live. Enjoy!

## Shandalar Old Border

So, you like the Shandalar plane, but miss "ye good olde days" of yore? Then Shandalar Old Border is for you. This is the Shandalar base plane, but with modifications so that everything is from the Scourge set, or older.

**STATUS:** 99% functional and live. Enjoy! (There may be the occasional bug found. if so, please report it so we can get it resolved.)
