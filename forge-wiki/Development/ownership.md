Everyone is free to work on whatever part they're interested in. This is just meant to be a rough overview for new contributors which areas are currently "understaffed" and could use some love.
The "Ancestors" column is basically there to list currently inactive developers that might still be around to provide implementation details on Discord. In that case please use the Search function and make a decent effort to understand the code first, unnecessary pinging for simple things might give you a bad reputation :P
