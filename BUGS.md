| 2 | Phase marker not updating on client | NetworkPlay | Fixed delta sync to track phase changes | - |
| 3 | Client hand not visible during mulligan | NetworkPlay | Changed GAMEVIEW_DELTA_KEY from 0 to Integer.MIN_VALUE to avoid ID collision | f06d2da2a7 |
| 4 | Collection deserialization fails to find object id=1 | NetworkPlay | Implemented composite delta keys throughout + fixed client-side type-specific lookup in createObjectFromData | 1d564ab2d8 |

## Debug Infrastructure

### NetworkDebugLogger

Location: `forge-gui/src/main/java/forge/gamemodes/net/NetworkDebugLogger.java`

Configurable logging for network debugging. Logs go to:
- Console (configurable level)
- File: `forge-gui-desktop/logs/`

Usage:
```java
NetworkDebugLogger.log("[Component] Message with %s formatting", args);
NetworkDebugLogger.debug("[Component] Detailed debug info");
NetworkDebugLogger.warn("[Component] Warning message");
NetworkDebugLogger.error("[Component] Error message");
```

### Log Prefixes

Key log prefixes used by NetworkDebugLogger:
- `[chooseSpellAbilityToPlay]` - Priority decisions (PlayerControllerHuman)
- `[InputQueue]` - Input stack management
- `[InputSyncronizedBase]` - Latch operations
- `[AI Takeover]` - AI conversion process
- `[DeltaSync]` - Delta synchronization
